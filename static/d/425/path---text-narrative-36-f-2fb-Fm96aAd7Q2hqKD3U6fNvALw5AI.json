Allez vous-en! Sapristi! That's all right!”</p>\n<p>He could speak a little Spanish, and also a language which nobody understood, unless it was the mocking-bird that hung on the other side of the door, whistling his fluty notes out upon the breeze with maddening persistence.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pontellier, unable to read his newspaper with any degree of comfort, arose with an expression and an exclamation of disgust.</p>\n<p>He walked down the gallery and across the narrow “bridges” which connected the Lebrun cottages one with the other. He had been seated before the door of the main house. The parrot and the mockingbird were the property of Madame Lebrun, and they had the right to make all the noise they wished. Mr. Pontellier had the privilege of quitting their society when they ceased to be entertaining.</p>\n<p>He stopped before the door of his own cottage, which was the fourth one from the main building and next to the last. Seating himself in a wicker rocker which was there, he once more applied himself to the task of reading the newspaper. The day was Sunday; the paper was a day old. The Sunday papers had not yet reached Grand Isle. He was already acquainted with the market reports, and he glanced restlessly over the editorials and bits of news which he had not had time to read before quitting New Orleans the day before.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pontellier wore eye-glasses. He was a man of forty, of medium height and rather slender build; he stooped a little. His hair was brown and straight, parted on one side. His beard was neatly and closely trimmed.</p>\n<p>Once in a while he withdrew his glance from the newspaper and looked about him. There was more noise than ever over at the house. The main building was called “the house,” to distinguish it from the cottages. The chattering and whistling birds were still at it. Two young girls, the Farival twins, were playing a duet from “Zampa” upon the piano. Madame Lebrun was bustling in and out, giving orders in a high key to a yard-boy whenever she got inside the house, and directions in an equally high voice to a dining-room servant whenever she got outside. She was a fresh, pretty woman, clad always in white with elbow sleeves. Her starched skirts crinkled as she came and went. Farther down, before one of the cottages, a lady in black was walking demurely up and down, telling her beads. A good many persons of the pension had gone over to the Cheniere Caminada in Beaudelet's lugger to hear mass. Some young people were out under the wateroaks playing croquet. Mr. Pontellier's two children were there--sturdy little fellows of four and five. A quadroon nurse followed them about with a faraway, meditative air.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pontellier finally lit a cigar and began to smoke, letting the paper drag idly from his hand. He fixed his gaze upon a white sunshade that was advancing at snail's pace from the beach. He could see it plainly between the gaunt trunks of the water-oaks and across the stretch of yellow camomile. The gulf looked far away, melting hazily into the blue of the horizon. The sunshade continued to approach slowly. Beneath its pink-lined shelter were his wife, Mrs. Pontellier, and young Robert Lebrun. When they reached the cottage, the two seated themselves with some appearance of fatigue upon the upper step of the porch, facing each other, each leaning against a supporting post.</p>\n<p>“What folly! to bathe at such an hour in such heat!” exclaimed Mr. Pontellier. He himself had taken a plunge at daylight. That was why the morning seemed long to him.</p>\n<p>“You are burnt beyond recognition,” he added, looking at his wife as one looks at a valuable piece of personal property which has suffered some damage. She held up her hands, strong, shapely hands, and surveyed them critically, drawing up her fawn sleeves above the wrists. Looking at them reminded her of her rings, which she had given to her husband before leaving for the beach. She silently reached out to him, and he, understanding, took the rings from his vest pocket and dropped them into her open palm. She slipped them upon her fingers; then clasping her knees, she looked across at Robert and began to laugh. The rings sparkled upon her fingers. He sent back an answering smile.</p>\n<p>“What is it?” asked Pontellier, looking lazily and amused from one to the other. It was some utter nonsense; some adventure out there in the water, and they both tried to relate it at once. It did not seem half so amusing when told. They realized this, and so did Mr. Pontellier. He yawned and stretched himself. Then he got up, saying he had half a mind to go over to Klein's hotel and play a game of billiards.</p>\n<p>“Come go along, Lebrun,” he proposed to Robert. But Robert admitted quite frankly that he preferred to stay where he was and talk to Mrs. Pontellier.</p>\n<p>“Well, send him about his business when he bores you, Edna,” instructed her husband as he prepared to leave.</p>\n<p>“Here, take the umbrella,” she exclaimed, holding it out to him. He accepted the sunshade, and lifting it over his head descended the steps and walked away.</p>\n<p>“Coming back to dinner?” his wife called after him. He halted a moment and shrugged his shoulders. He felt in his vest pocket; there was a ten-dollar bill there. He did not know; perhaps he would return for the early dinner and perhaps he would not. It all depended upon the company which he found over at Klein's and the size of “the game.” He did not say this, but she understood it, and laughed, nodding good-by to him.</p>\n<p>Both children wanted to follow their father when they saw him starting out. He kissed them and promised to bring them back bonbons and peanuts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ii\"><a href=\"#ii\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>II</h2>\n<p>Mrs. Pontellier's eyes were quick and bright; they were a yellowish\nbrown, about the color of her hair. She had a way of turning them\nswiftly upon an object and holding them there as if lost in some inward\nmaze of contemplation or thought.</p>\n<p>Her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair. They were thick and\nalmost horizontal, emphasizing the depth of her eyes. She was rather\nhandsome than beautiful. Her face was captivating by reason of a certain\nfrankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features. Her\nmanner was engaging.</p>\n<p>Robert rolled a cigarette. He smoked cigarettes because he could\nnot afford cigars, he said. He had a cigar in his pocket which Mr.\nPontellier had presented him with, and he was saving it for his\nafter-dinner smoke.</p>\n<p>This seemed quite proper and natural on his part. In coloring he was\nnot unlike his companion. A clean-shaved face made the resemblance more\npronounced than it would otherwise have been. There rested no shadow of\ncare upon his open countenance. His eyes gathered in and reflected the\nlight and languor of the summer day.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Pontellier reached over for a palm-leaf fan that lay on the porch\nand began to fan herself, while Robert sent between his lips light puffs\nfrom his cigarette. They chatted incessantly: about the things around\nthem; their amusing adventure out in the water--it had again assumed its\nentertaining aspect; about the wind, the trees, the people who had gone\nto the Cheniere; about the children playing croquet under the oaks, and\nthe Farival twins, who were now performing the overture to “The Poet and\nthe Peasant.”</p>\n<p>Robert talked a good deal about himself. He was very young, and did not\nknow any better. Mrs. Pontellier talked a little about herself for the\nsame reason. Each was interested in what the other said. Robert spoke of\nhis intention to go to Mexico in the autumn, where fortune awaited him.\nHe was always intending to go to Mexico, but some way never got there.\nMeanwhile he held on to his modest position in a mercantile house in\nNew Orleans, where an equal familiarity with English, French and Spanish\ngave him no small value as a clerk and correspondent.</p>\n<p>He was spending his summer vacation, as he always did, with his mother\nat Grand Isle. In former times, before Robert could remember, “the\nhouse” had been a summer luxury of the Lebruns. Now, flanked by its\ndozen or more cottages, which were always filled with exclusive visitors\nfrom the “Quartier Francais,” it enabled Madame Lebrun to maintain the\neasy and comfortable existence which appeared to be her birthright.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Pontellier talked about her father's Mississippi plantation and her\ngirlhood home in the old Kentucky bluegrass country. She was an American\nwoman, with a small infusion of French which seemed to have been lost in\ndilution. She read a letter from her sister, who was away in the East,\nand who had engaged herself to be married. Robert was interested, and\nwanted to know what manner of girls the sisters were, what the father\nwas like, and how long the mother had been dead.</p>\n<p>When Mrs. Pontellier folded the letter it was time for her to dress for\nthe early dinner.</p>\n<p>“I see Leonce isn't coming back,” she said, with a glance in the\ndirection whence her husband had disappeared. Robert supposed he was\nnot, as there were a good many New Orleans club men over at Klein's.</p>\n<p>When Mrs. Pontellier left him to enter her room, the young man descended\nthe steps and strolled over toward the croquet players, where,\nduring the half-hour before dinner, he amused himself with the little\nPontellier children, who were very fond of him.</p>\n<p>III</p>\n<p>It was eleven o'clock that night when Mr. Pontellier returned from\nKlein's hotel. He was in an excellent humor, in high spirits, and very\ntalkative. His entrance awoke his wife, who was in bed and fast asleep\nwhen he came in. He talked to her while he undressed, telling her\nanecdotes and bits of news and gossip that he had gathered during the\nday. From his trousers pockets he took a fistful of crumpled bank\nnotes and a good deal of silver coin, which he piled on the bureau\nindiscriminately with keys, knife, handkerchief, and whatever else\nhappened to be in his pockets. She was overcome with sleep, and answered\nhim with little half utterances.</p>\n<p>He thought it very discouraging that his wife, who was the sole object\nof his existence, evinced so little interest in things which concerned\nhim, and valued so little his conversation.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pontellier had forgotten the bonbons and peanuts for the boys.\nNotwithstanding he loved them very much, and went into the adjoining\nroom where they slept to take a look at them and make sure that they\nwere resting comfortably. The result of his investigation was far from\nsatisfactory. He turned and shifted the youngsters about in bed. One of\nthem began to kick and talk about a basket full of crabs.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pontellier returned to his wife with the information that Raoul had\na high fever and needed looking after. Then he lit a cigar and went and\nsat near the open door to smoke it.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Pontellier was quite sure Raoul had no fever. He had gone to\nbed perfectly well, she said, and nothing had ailed him all day. Mr.\nPontellier was too well acquainted with fever symptoms to be mistaken.\nHe assured her the child was consuming at that moment in the next room.</p>\n<p>He reproached his wife with her inattention, her habitual neglect of the\nchildren. If it was not a mother's place to look after children, whose\non earth was it? He himself had his hands full with his brokerage\nbusiness. He could not be in two places at once; making a living for\nhis family on the street, and staying at home to see that no harm befell\nthem. He talked in a monotonous, insistent way.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Pontellier sprang out of bed and went into the next room. She soon\ncame back and sat on the edge of the bed, leaning her head down on the\npillow. She said nothing, and refused to answer her husband when he\nquestioned her. When his cigar was smoked out he went to bed, and in\nhalf a minute he was fast asleep.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Pontellier was by that time thoroughly awake. She began to cry a\nlittle, and wiped her eyes on the sleeve of her peignoir. Blowing out\nthe candle, which her husband had left burning, she slipped her bare\nfeet into a pair of satin mules at the foot of the bed and went out\non the porch, where she sat down in the wicker chair and began to rock\ngently to and fro.</p>\n<p>It was then past midnight. The cottages were all dark. A single faint\nlight gleamed out from the hallway of the house. There was no sound\nabroad except the hooting of an old owl in the top of a water-oak, and\nthe everlasting voice of the sea, that was not uplifted at that soft\nhour. It broke like a mournful lullaby upon the night.</p>\n<p>The tears came so fast to Mrs. Pontellier's eyes that the damp sleeve of\nher peignoir no longer served to dry them. She was holding the back\nof her chair with one hand; her loose sleeve had slipped almost to the\nshoulder of her uplifted arm. Turning, she thrust her face, steaming and\nwet, into the bend of her arm, and she went on crying there, not caring\nany longer to dry her face, her eyes, her arms. She could not have told\nwhy she was crying. Such experiences as the foregoing were not uncommon\nin her married life. They seemed never before to have weighed much\nagainst the abundance of her husband's kindness and a uniform devotion\nwhich had come to be tacit and self-understood.</p>\n<p>An indescribable oppression, which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar\npart of her consciousness, filled her whole being with a vague anguish.\nIt was like a shadow, like a mist passing across her soul's summer day.\nIt was strange and unfamiliar; it was a mood. She did not sit there\ninwardly upbraiding her husband, lamenting at Fate, which had directed\nher footsteps to the path which they had taken. She was just having a\ngood cry all to herself. The mosquitoes made merry over her, biting her\nfirm, round arms and nipping at her bare insteps.</p>\n<p>The little stinging, buzzing imps succeeded in dispelling a mood which\nmight have held her there in the darkness half a night longer.</p>\n<p>The following morning Mr. Pontellier was up in good time to take the\nrockaway which was to convey him to the steamer at the wharf. He was\nreturning to the city to his business, and they would not see him again\nat the Island till the coming Saturday. He had regained his composure,\nwhich seemed to have been somewhat impaired the night before. He was\neager to be gone, as he looked forward to a lively week in Carondelet\nStreet.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pontellier gave his wife half of the money which he had brought away\nfrom Klein's hotel the evening before. She liked money as well as most\nwomen, and accepted it with no little satisfaction.</p>\n<p>“It will buy a handsome wedding present for Sister Janet!” she\nexclaimed, smoothing out the bills as she counted them one by one.</p>\n<p>“Oh! we'll treat Sister Janet better than that, my dear,” he laughed, as\nhe prepared to kiss her good-by.</p>\n<p>The boys were tumbling about, clinging to his legs, imploring that\nnumerous things be brought back to them. Mr. Pontellier was a great\nfavorite, and ladies, men, children, even nurses, were always on hand to\nsay goodby to him. His wife stood smiling and waving, the boys shouting,\nas he disappeared in the old rockaway down the sandy road.</p>\n<p>A few days later a box arrived for Mrs. Pontellier from New Orleans. It\nwas from her husband. It was filled with friandises, with luscious\nand toothsome bits--the finest of fruits, pates, a rare bottle or two,\ndelicious syrups, and bonbons in abundance.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Pontellier was always very generous with the contents of such a\nbox; she was quite used to receiving them when away from home. The\npates and fruit were brought to the dining-room; the bonbons were passed\naround. And the ladies, selecting with dainty and discriminating fingers\nand a little greedily, all declared that Mr. Pontellier was the best\nhusband in the world. Mrs. Pontellier was forced to admit that she knew\nof none better.</p>\n<p>IV</p>\n<p>It would have been a difficult matter for Mr. Pontellier to define to\nhis own satisfaction or any one else's wherein his wife failed in her\nduty toward their children. It was something which he felt rather than\nperceived, and he never voiced the feeling without subsequent regret and\nample atonement.</p>\n<p>If one of the little Pontellier boys took a tumble whilst at play, he\nwas not apt to rush crying to his mother's arms for comfort; he would\nmore likely pick himself up, wipe the water out of his eyes and the\nsand out of his mouth, and go on playing. Tots as they were, they pulled\ntogether and stood their ground in childish battles with doubled\nfists and uplifted voices, which usually prevailed against the other\nmother-tots. The quadroon nurse was looked upon as a huge encumbrance,\nonly good to button up waists and panties and to brush and part hair;\nsince it seemed to be a law of society that hair must be parted and\nbrushed.</p>\n<p>In short, Mrs. Pontellier was not a mother-woman. The mother-women\nseemed to prevail that summer at Grand Isle. It was easy to know them,\nfluttering about with extended, protecting wings when any harm, real or\nimaginary, threatened their precious brood. They were women who idolized\ntheir children, worshiped their husbands, and esteemed it a holy\nprivilege to efface themselves as individuals and grow wings as\nministering angels.</p>\n<p>Many of them were delicious in the role; one of them was the embodiment\nof every womanly grace and charm. If her husband did not adore her,\nhe was a brute, deserving of death by slow torture. Her name was Adele\nRatignolle. There are no words to describe her save the old ones that\nhave served so often to picture the bygone heroine of romance and the\nfair lady of our dreams. There was nothing subtle or hidden about her\ncharms; her beauty was all there, flaming and apparent: the spun-gold\nhair that comb nor confining pin could restrain; the blue eyes that were\nlike nothing but sapphires; two lips that pouted, that were so red one\ncould only think of cherries or some other delicious crimson fruit in\nlooking at them. She was growing a little stout, but it did not seem to\ndetract an iota from the grace of every step, pose, gesture. One would\nnot have wanted her white neck a mite less full or her beautiful arms\nmore slender. Never were hands more exquisite than hers, and it was a\njoy to look at them when she threaded her needle or adjusted her gold\nthimble to her taper middle finger as she sewed away on the little\nnight-drawers or fashioned a bodice or a bib.</p>\n<p>Madame Ratignolle was very fond of Mrs. Pontellier, and often she took\nher sewing and went over to sit with her in the afternoons. She was\nsitting there the afternoon of the day the box arrived from New Orleans.\nShe had possession of the rocker, and she was busily engaged in sewing\nupon a diminutive pair of night-drawers.</p>\n<p>She had brought the pattern of the drawers for Mrs. Pontellier to cut\nout--a marvel of construction, fashioned to enclose a baby's body so\neffectually that only two small eyes might look out from the garment,\nlike an Eskimo's. They were designed for winter wear, when treacherous\ndrafts came down chimneys and insidious currents of deadly cold found\ntheir way through key-holes.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Pontellier's mind was quite at rest concerning the present material\nneeds of her children, and she could not see the use of anticipating and\nmaking winter night garments the subject of her summer meditations.\nBut she did not want to appear unamiable and uninterested, so she\nhad brought forth newspapers, which she spread upon the floor of the\ngallery, and under Madame Ratignolle's directions she had cut a pattern\nof the impervious garment.</p>\n<p>Robert was there, seated as he had been the Sunday before, and Mrs.\nPontellier also occupied her former position on the upper step, leaning\nlistlessly against the post. Beside her was a box of bonbons, which she\nheld out at intervals to Madame Ratignolle.</p>\n<p>That lady seemed at a loss to make a selection, but finally settled upon\na stick of nougat, wondering if it were not too rich; whether it could\npossibly hurt her. Madame Ratignolle had been married seven years. About\nevery two years she had a baby. At that time she had three babies, and\nwas beginning to think of a fourth one. She was always talking about her\n“condition.” Her “condition” was in no way apparent, and no one would\nhave known a thing about it but for her persistence in making it the\nsubject of conversation.</p>\n<p>Robert started to reassure her, asserting that he had known a lady who\nhad subsisted upon nougat during the entire--but seeing the color mount\ninto Mrs. Pontellier's face he checked himself and changed the subject.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Pontellier, though she had married a Creole, was not thoroughly\nat home in the society of Creoles; never before had she been thrown so\nintimately among them. There were only Creoles that summer at Lebrun's.\nThey all knew each other, and felt like one large family, among\nwhom existed the most amicable relations. A characteristic which\ndistinguished them and which impressed Mrs. Pontellier most forcibly\nwas their entire absence of prudery. Their freedom of expression was\nat first incomprehensible to her, though she had no difficulty in\nreconciling it with a lofty chastity which in the Creole woman seems to\nbe inborn and unmistakable.</p>\n<p>Never would Edna Pontellier forget the shock with which she heard Madame\nRatignolle relating to old Monsieur Farival the harrowing story of one\nof her accouchements, withholding no intimate detail. She was growing\naccustomed to like shocks, but she could not keep the mounting color\nback from her cheeks. Oftener than once her coming had interrupted the\ndroll story with which Robert was entertaining some amused group of\nmarried women.</p>\n<p>A book had gone the rounds of the pension. When it came her turn to read\nit, she did so with profound astonishment. She felt moved to read the\nbook in secret and solitude, though none of the others had done so,--to\nhide it from view at the sound of approaching footsteps. It was openly\ncriticised and freely discussed at table. Mrs. Pontellier gave over\nbeing astonished, and concluded that wonders would never cease.</p>\n<p>V</p>\n<p>They formed a congenial group sitting there that summer\nafternoon--Madame Ratignolle sewing away, often stopping to relate a\nstory or incident with much expressive gesture of her perfect hands;\nRobert and Mrs. Pontellier sitting idle, exchanging occasional words,\nglances or smiles which indicated a certain advanced stage of intimacy\nand camaraderie.</p>\n<p>He had lived in her shadow during the past month. No one thought\nanything of it. Many had predicted that Robert would devote himself to\nMrs. Pontellier when he arrived. Since the age of fifteen, which was\neleven years before, Robert each summer at Grand Isle had constituted\nhimself the devoted attendant of some fair dame or damsel. Sometimes\nit was a young girl, again a widow; but as often as not it was some\ninteresting married woman.</p>\n<p>For two consecutive seasons he lived in the sunlight of Mademoiselle\nDuvigne's presence. But she died between summers; then Robert posed as\nan inconsolable, prostrating himself at the feet of Madame Ratignolle\nfor whatever crumbs of sympathy and comfort she might be pleased to\nvouchsafe.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Pontellier liked to sit and gaze at her fair companion as she might\nlook upon a faultless Madonna.</p>\n<p>“Could any one fathom the cruelty beneath that fair exterior?” murmured\nRobert. “She knew that I adored her once, and she let me adore her. It\nwas 'Robert, come; go; stand up; sit down; do this; do that; see if the\nbaby sleeps; my thimble, please, that I left God knows where. Come and\nread Daudet to me while I sew.'”</p>\n<p>“Par exemple! I never had to ask. You were always there under my feet,\nlike a troublesome cat.”</p>\n<p>“You mean like an adoring dog. And just as soon as Ratignolle appeared\non the scene, then it WAS like a dog. 'Passez! Adieu! Allez vous-en!'”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps I feared to make Alphonse jealous,” she interjoined, with\nexcessive naivete. That made them all laugh. The right hand jealous of\nthe left! The heart jealous of the soul! But for that matter, the Creole\nhusband is never jealous; with him the gangrene passion is one which has\nbecome dwarfed by disuse.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile Robert, addressing Mrs Pontellier, continued to tell of his\none time hopeless passion for Madame Ratignolle; of sleepless nights,\nof consuming flames till the very sea sizzled when he took his\ndaily plunge. While the lady at the needle kept up a little running,\ncontemptuous comment:</p>\n<p>“Blagueur--farceur--gros bete, va!”</p>\n<p>He never assumed this seriocomic tone when alone with Mrs. Pontellier.\nShe never knew precisely what to make of it; at that moment it was\nimpossible for her to guess how much of it was jest and what proportion\nwas earnest. It was understood that he had often spoken words of love\nto Madame Ratignolle, without any thought of being taken seriously. Mrs.\nPontellier was glad he had not assumed a similar role toward herself. It\nwould have been unacceptable and annoying.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Pontellier had brought her sketching materials, which she sometimes\ndabbled with in an unprofessional way. She liked the dabbling. She felt\nin it satisfaction of a kind which no other employment afforded her.</p>\n<p>She had long wished to try herself on Madame Ratignolle. Never had that\nlady seemed a more tempting subject than at that moment, seated there\nlike some sensuous Madonna, with the gleam of the fading day enriching\nher splendid color.</p>\n<p>Robert crossed over and seated himself upon the step below Mrs.\nPontellier, that he might watch her work. She handled her brushes with\na certain ease and freedom which came, not from long and close\nacquaintance with them, but from a natural aptitude. Robert followed her\nwork with close attention, giving forth little ejaculatory expressions\nof appreciation in French, which he addressed to Madame Ratignolle.</p>\n<p>“Mais ce n'est pas mal! Elle s'y connait, elle a de la force, oui.”</p>\n<p>During his oblivious attention he once quietly rested his head against\nMrs. Pontellier's arm. As gently she repulsed him. Once again he\nrepeated the offense. She could not but believe it to be thoughtlessness\non his part; yet that was no reason she should submit to it. She did not\nremonstrate, except again to repulse him quietly but firmly. He\noffered no apology. The picture completed bore no resemblance to Madame\nRatignolle. She was greatly disappointed to find that it did not look\nlike her. But it was a fair enough piece of work, and in many respects\nsatisfying.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Pontellier evidently did not think so. After surveying the sketch\ncritically she drew a broad smudge of paint across its surface, and\ncrumpled the paper between her hands.</p>\n<p>The youngsters came tumbling up the steps, the quadroon following at the\nrespectful distance which they required her to observe. Mrs. Pontellier\nmade them carry her paints and things into the house. She sought to\ndetain them for a little talk and some pleasantry. But they were greatly\nin earnest. They had only come to investigate the contents of the bonbon\nbox. They accepted without murmuring what she chose to give them, each\nholding out two chubby hands scoop-like, in the vain hope that they\nmight be filled; and then away they went.</p>\n<p>The sun was low in the west, and the breeze soft and languorous that\ncame up from the south, charged with the seductive odor of the sea.\nChildren freshly befurbelowed, were gathering for their games under the\noaks. Their voices were high and penetrating.</p>\n<p>Madame Ratignolle folded her sewing, placing thimble, scissors, and\nthread all neatly together in the roll, which she pinned securely. She\ncomplained of faintness. Mrs. Pontellier flew for the cologne water and\na fan. She bathed Madame Ratignolle's face with cologne, while Robert\nplied the fan with unnecessary vigor.</p>\n<p>The spell was soon over, and Mrs. Pontellier could not help wondering if\nthere were not a little imagination responsible for its origin, for the\nrose tint had never faded from her friend's face.</p>\n<p>She stood watching the fair woman walk down the long line of galleries\nwith the grace and majesty which queens are sometimes supposed to\npossess. Her little ones ran to meet her. Two of them clung about her\nwhite skirts, the third she took from its nurse and with a thousand\nendearments bore it along in her own fond, encircling arms. Though, as\neverybody well knew, the doctor had forbidden her to lift so much as a\npin!</p>\n<p>“Are you going bathing?” asked Robert of Mrs. Pontellier. It was not so\nmuch a question as a reminder.</p>\n<p>“Oh, no,” she answered, with a tone of indecision. “I'm tired; I think\nnot.” Her glance wandered from his face away toward the Gulf, whose\nsonorous murmur reached her like a loving but imperative entreaty.</p>\n<p>“Oh, come!” he insisted. “You mustn't miss your bath. Come on. The water\nmust be delicious; it will not hurt you. Come.”</p>\n<p>He reached up for her big, rough straw hat that hung on a peg outside\nthe door, and put it on her head. They descended the steps, and walked\naway together toward the beach. The sun was low in the west and the\nbreeze was soft and warm.</p>\n<p>VI</p>\n<p>Edna Pontellier could not have told why, wishing to go to the beach with\nRobert, she should in the first place have declined, and in the second\nplace have followed in obedience to one of the two contradictory\nimpulses which impelled her.</p>\n<p>A certain light was beginning to dawn dimly within her,--the light\nwhich, showing the way, forbids it.</p>\n<p>At that early period it served but to bewilder her. It moved her to\ndreams, to thoughtfulness, to the shadowy anguish which had overcome her\nthe midnight when she had abandoned herself to tears.</p>\n<p>In short, Mrs. Pontellier was beginning to realize her position in\nthe universe as a human being, and to recognize her relations as an\nindividual to the world within and about her. This may seem like a\nponderous weight of wisdom to descend upon the soul of a young woman of\ntwenty-eight--perhaps more wisdom than the Holy Ghost is usually pleased\nto vouchsafe to any woman.</p>\n<p>But the beginning of things, of a world especially, is necessarily\nvague, tangled, chaotic, and exceedingly disturbing. How few of us ever\nemerge from such beginning! How many souls perish in its tumult!</p>\n<p>The voice of the sea is seductive; never ceasing, whispering, clamoring,\nmurmuring, inviting the soul to wander for a spell in abysses of\nsolitude; to lose itself in mazes of inward contemplation.</p>\n<p>The voice of the sea speaks to the soul. The touch of the sea is\nsensuous, enfolding the body in its soft, close embrace.</p>\n<p>VII</p>\n<p>Mrs. Pontellier was not a woman given to confidences, a characteristic\nhitherto contrary to her nature. Even as a child she had lived her\nown small life all within herself. At a very early period she had\napprehended instinctively the dual life--that outward existence which\nconforms, the inward life which questions.</p>\n<p>That summer at Grand Isle she began to loosen a little the mantle of\nreserve that had always enveloped her. There may have been--there\nmust have been--influences, both subtle and apparent, working in their\nseveral ways to induce her to do this; but the most obvious was the\ninfluence of Adele Ratignolle. The excessive physical charm of the\nCreole had first attracted her, for Edna had a sensuous susceptibility\nto beauty. Then the candor of the woman's whole existence, which every\none might read, and which formed so striking a contrast to her own\nhabitual reserve--this might have furnished a link. Who can tell what\nmetals the gods use in forging the subtle bond which we call sympathy,\nwhich we might as well call love.</p>\n<p>The two women went away one morning to the beach together, arm in arm,\nunder the huge white sunshade. Edna had prevailed upon Madame Ratignolle\nto leave the children behind, though she could not induce her to\nrelinquish a diminutive roll of needlework, which Adele begged to be\nallowed to slip into the depths of her pocket. In some unaccountable way\nthey had escaped from Robert.</p>\n<p>The walk to the beach was no inconsiderable one, consisting as it did\nof a long, sandy path, upon which a sporadic and tangled growth that\nbordered it on either side made frequent and unexpected inroads. There\nwere acres of yellow camomile reaching out on either hand. Further away\nstill, vegetable gardens abounded, with frequent small plantations of\norange or lemon trees intervening. The dark green clusters glistened\nfrom afar in the sun.</p>\n<p>The women were both of goodly height, Madame Ratignolle possessing\nthe more feminine and matronly figure. The charm of Edna Pontellier's\nphysique stole insensibly upon you. The lines of her body were long,\nclean and symmetrical; it was a body which occasionally fell into\nsplendid poses; there was no suggestion of the trim, stereotyped\nfashion-plate about it. A casual and indiscriminating observer, in\npassing, might not cast a second glance upon the figure. But with more\nfeeling and discernment he would have recognized the noble beauty of its\nmodeling, and the graceful severity of poise and movement, which made\nEdna Pontellier different from the crowd.</p>\n<p>She wore a cool muslin that morning--white, with a waving vertical line\nof brown running through it; also a white linen collar and the big straw\nhat which she had taken from the peg outside the door. The hat rested\nany way on her yellow-brown hair, that waved a little, was heavy, and\nclung close to her head.</p>\n<p>Madame Ratignolle, more careful of her complexion, had twined a gauze\nveil about her head. She wore dogskin gloves, with gauntlets that\nprotected her wrists. She was dressed in pure white, with a fluffiness\nof ruffles that became her. The draperies and fluttering things which\nshe wore suited her rich, luxuriant beauty as a greater severity of line\ncould not have done.</p>\n<p>There were a number of bath-houses along the beach, of rough but solid\nconstruction, built with small, protecting galleries facing the water.\nEach house consisted of two compartments, and each family at Lebrun's\npossessed a compartment for itself, fitted out with all the essential\nparaphernalia of the bath and whatever other conveniences the owners\nmight desire. The two women had no intention of bathing; they had just\nstrolled down to the beach for a walk and to be alone and near the\nwater. The Pontellier and Ratignolle compartments adjoined one another\nunder the same roof.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Pontellier had brought down her key through force of habit.\nUnlocking the door of her bath-room she went inside, and soon emerged,\nbringing a rug, which she spread upon the floor of the gallery, and two\nhuge hair pillows covered with crash, which she placed against the front\nof the building.</p>\n<p>The two seated themselves there in the shade of the porch, side by side,\nwith their backs against the pillows and their feet extended. Madame\nRatignolle removed her veil, wiped her face with a rather delicate\nhandkerchief, and fanned herself with the fan which she always carried\nsuspended somewhere about her person by a long, narrow ribbon. Edna\nremoved her collar and opened her dress at the throat. She took the fan\nfrom Madame Ratignolle and began to fan both herself and her companion.\nIt was very warm, and for a while they did nothing but exchange remarks\nabout the heat, the sun, the glare. But there was a breeze blowing, a\nchoppy, stiff wind that whipped the water into froth. It fluttered the\nskirts of the two women and kept them for a while engaged in adjusting,\nreadjusting, tucking in, securing hair-pins and hat-pins. A few persons\nwere sporting some distance away in the water. The beach was very still\nof human sound at that hour. The lady in black was reading her morning\ndevotions on the porch of a neighboring bathhouse. Two young lovers were\nexchanging their hearts' yearnings beneath the children's tent, which\nthey had found unoccupied.</p>\n<p>Edna Pontellier, casting her eyes about, had finally kept them at rest\nupon the sea. The day was clear and carried the gaze out as far as the\nblue sky went; there were a few white clouds suspended idly over the\nhorizon. A lateen sail was visible in the direction of Cat Island, and\nothers to the south seemed almost motionless in the far distance.</p>\n<p>“Of whom--of what are you thinking?” asked Adele of her companion,\nwhose countenance she had been watching with a little amused attention,\narrested by the absorbed expression which seemed to have seized and\nfixed every feature into a statuesque repose.</p>\n<p>“Nothing,” returned Mrs. Pontellier, with a start, adding at once: “How\nstupid! But it seems to me it is the reply we make instinctively to\nsuch a question. Let me see,” she went on, throwing back her head and\nnarrowing her fine eyes till they shone like two vivid points of light.\n“Let me see. I was really not conscious of thinking of anything; but\nperhaps I can retrace my thoughts.”</p>\n<p>“Oh! never mind!” laughed Madame Ratignolle. “I am not quite so\nexacting. I will let you off this time. It is really too hot to think,\nespecially to think about thinking.”</p>\n<p>“But for the fun of it,” persisted Edna. “First of all, the sight of the\nwater stretching so far away, those motionless sails against the blue\nsky, made a delicious picture that I just wanted to sit and look at. The\nhot wind beating in my face made me think--without any connection that I\ncan trace of a summer day in Kentucky, of a meadow that seemed as big as\nthe ocean to the very little girl walking through the grass, which was\nhigher than her waist. She threw out her arms as if swimming when she\nwalked, beating the tall grass as one strikes out in the water. Oh, I\nsee the connection now!”</p>\n<p>“Where were you going that day in Kentucky, walking through the grass?”</p>\n<p>“I don't remember now. I was just walking diagonally across a big field.\nMy sun-bonnet obstructed the view. I could see only the stretch of green\nbefore me, and I felt as if I must walk on forever, without coming to\nthe end of it. I don't remember whether I was frightened or pleased. I\nmust have been entertained.</p>\n<p>“Likely as not it was Sunday,” she laughed; “and I was running away from\nprayers, from the Presbyterian service, read in a spirit of gloom by my\nfather that chills me yet to think of.”</p>\n<p>“And have you been running away from prayers ever since, ma chere?”\nasked Madame Ratignolle, amused.</p>\n<p>“No! oh, no!” Edna hastened to say. “I was a little unthinking child in\nthose days, just following a misleading impulse without question. On the\ncontrary, during one period of my life religion took a firm hold upon\nme; after I was twelve and until--until--why, I suppose until now, though\nI never thought much about it--just driven along by habit. But do you\nknow,” she broke off, turning her quick eyes upon Madame Ratignolle and\nleaning forward a little so as to bring her face quite close to that\nof her companion, “sometimes I feel this summer as if I were walking\nthrough the green meadow again; idly, aimlessly, unthinking and\nunguided.”</p>\n<p>Madame Ratignolle laid her hand over that of Mrs. Pontellier, which was\nnear her. Seeing that the hand was not withdrawn, she clasped it firmly\nand warmly. She even stroked it a little, fondly, with the other hand,\nmurmuring in an undertone, “Pauvre cherie.”</p>\n<p>The action was at first a little confusing to Edna, but she soon lent\nherself readily to the Creole's gentle caress. She was not accustomed to\nan outward and spoken expression of affection, either in herself or in\nothers. She and her younger sister, Janet, had quarreled a good deal\nthrough force of unfortunate habit. Her older sister, Margaret, was\nmatronly and dignified, probably from having assumed matronly and\nhousewifely responsibilities too early in life, their mother having\ndied when they were quite young, Margaret was not effusive; she\nwas practical. Edna had had an occasional girl friend, but whether\naccidentally or not, they seemed to have been all of one type--the\nself-contained. She never realized that the reserve of her own character\nhad much, perhaps everything, to do with this. Her most intimate friend\nat school had been one of rather exceptional intellectual gifts, who\nwrote fine-sounding essays, which Edna admired and strove to imitate;\nand with her she talked and glowed over the English classics, and\nsometimes held religious and political controversies.</p>\n<p>Edna often wondered at one propensity which sometimes had inwardly\ndisturbed her without causing any outward show or manifestation on her\npart. At a very early age--perhaps it was when she traversed the ocean\nof waving grass--she remembered that she had been passionately enamored\nof a dignified and sad-eyed cavalry officer who visited her father in\nKentucky. She could not leave his presence when he was there, nor remove\nher eyes from his face, which was something like Napoleon's, with a\nlock of black hair failing across the forehead. But the cavalry officer\nmelted imperceptibly out of her existence.</p>\n<p>At another time her affections were deeply engaged by a young gentleman\nwho visited a lady on a neighboring plantation. It was after they went\nto Mississippi to live. The young man was engaged to be married to the\nyoung lady, and they sometimes called upon Margaret, driving over of\nafternoons in a buggy. Edna was a little miss, just merging into her\nteens; and the realization that she herself was nothing, nothing,\nnothing to the engaged young man was a bitter affliction to her. But he,\ntoo, went the way of dreams.</p>\n<p>She was a grown young woman when she was overtaken by what she supposed\nto be the climax of her fate. It was when the face and figure of a\ngreat tragedian began to haunt her imagination and stir her senses. The\npersistence of the infatuation lent it an aspect of genuineness. The\nhopelessness of it colored it with the lofty tones of a great passion.</p>\n<p>The picture of the tragedian stood enframed upon her desk. Any one\nmay possess the portrait of a tragedian without exciting suspicion or\ncomment. (This was a sinister reflection which she cherished.) In the\npresence of others she expressed admiration for his exalted gifts, as\nshe handed the photograph around and dwelt upon the fidelity of the\nlikeness. When alone she sometimes picked it up and kissed the cold\nglass passionately.</p>\n<p>Her marriage to Leonce Pontellier was purely an accident, in this\nrespect resembling many other marriages which masquerade as the decrees\nof Fate. It was in the midst of her secret great passion that she met\nhim. He fell in love, as men are in the habit of doing, and pressed his\nsuit with an earnestness and an ardor which left nothing to be desired.\nHe pleased her; his absolute devotion flattered her. She fancied there\nwas a sympathy of thought and taste between them, in which fancy she\nwas mistaken. Add to this the violent opposition of her father and her\nsister Margaret to her marriage with a Catholic, and we need seek no\nfurther for the motives which led her to accept Monsieur Pontellier for\nher husband.</p>\n<p>The acme of bliss, which would have been a marriage with the tragedian,\nwas not for her in this world. As the devoted wife of a man who\nworshiped her, she felt she would take her place with a certain dignity\nin the world of reality, closing the portals forever behind her upon the\nrealm of romance and dreams.</p>\n<p>But it was not long before the tragedian had gone to join the cavalry\nofficer and the engaged young man and a few others; and Edna found\nherself face to face with the realities. She grew fond of her husband,\nrealizing with some unaccountable satisfaction that no trace of passion\nor excessive and fictitious warmth colored her affection, thereby\nthreatening its dissolution.</p>\n<p>She was fond of her children in an uneven, impulsive way. She would\nsometimes gather them passionately to her heart; she would sometimes\nforget them. The year before they had spent part of the summer with\ntheir grandmother Pontellier in Iberville. Feeling secure regarding\ntheir happiness and welfare, she did not miss them except with an\noccasional intense longing. Their absence was a sort of relief, though\nshe did not admit this, even to herself. It seemed to free her of a\nresponsibility which she had blindly assumed and for which Fate had not\nfitted her.</p>\n<p>Edna did not reveal so much as all this to Madame Ratignolle that summer\nday when they sat with faces turned to the sea. But a good part of it\nescaped her. She had put her head down on Madame Ratignolle's shoulder.\nShe was flushed and felt intoxicated with the sound of her own voice and\nthe unaccustomed taste of candor. It muddled her like wine, or like a\nfirst breath of freedom.</p>\n<p>There was the sound of approaching voices. It was Robert, surrounded by\na troop of children, searching for them. The two little Pontelliers were\nwith him, and he carried Madame Ratignolle's little girl in his arms.\nThere were other children beside, and two nurse-maids followed, looking\ndisagreeable and resigned.</p>\n<p>The women at once rose and began to shake out their draperies and relax\ntheir muscles. Mrs. Pontellier threw the cushions and rug into the\nbath-house. The children all scampered off to the awning, and they stood\nthere in a line, gazing upon the intruding lovers, still exchanging\ntheir vows and sighs. The lovers got up, with only a silent protest, and\nwalked slowly away somewhere else.</p>\n<p>The children possessed themselves of the tent, and Mrs. Pontellier went\nover to join them.</p>\n<p>Madame Ratignolle begged Robert to accompany her to the house; she\ncomplained of cramp in her limbs and stiffness of the joints. She leaned\ndraggingly upon his arm as they walked.</p>\n<p>VIII</p>\n<p>“Do me a favor, Robert,” spoke the pretty woman at his side, almost as\nsoon as she and Robert had started their slow, homeward way. She looked\nup in his face, leaning on his arm beneath the encircling shadow of the\numbrella which he had lifted.</p>\n<p>“Granted; as many as you like,” he returned, glancing down into her eyes\nthat were full of thoughtfulness and some speculation.</p>\n<p>“I only ask for one; let Mrs. Pontellier alone.”</p>\n<p>“Tiens!” he exclaimed, with a sudden, boyish laugh. “Voila que Madame\nRatignolle est jalouse!”</p>\n<p>“Nonsense! I'm in earnest; I mean what I say. Let Mrs. Pontellier\nalone.”</p>\n<p>“Why?” he asked; himself growing serious at his companion's\nsolicitation.</p>\n<p>“She is not one of us; she is not like us. She might make the\nunfortunate blunder of taking you seriously.”</p>\n<p>His face flushed with annoyance, and taking off his soft hat he began\nto beat it impatiently against his leg as he walked. “Why shouldn't she\ntake me seriously?” he demanded sharply. “Am I a comedian, a clown, a\njack-in-the-box? Why shouldn't she? You Creoles! I have no patience with\nyou! Am I always to be regarded as a feature of an amusing programme? I\nhope Mrs. Pontellier does take me seriously. I hope she has discernment\nenough to find in me something besides the blagueur. If I thought there\nwas any doubt--”</p>\n<p>“Oh, enough, Robert!” she broke into his heated outburst. “You are\nnot thinking of what you are saying. You speak with about as little\nreflection as we might expect from one of those children down there\nplaying in the sand. If your attentions to any married women here were\never offered with any intention of being convincing, you would not be\nthe gentleman we all know you to be, and you would be unfit to associate\nwith the wives and daughters of the people who trust you.”</p>\n<p>Madame Ratignolle had spoken what she believed to be the law and the\ngospel. The young man shrugged his shoulders impatiently.</p>\n<p>“Oh! well! That isn't it,” slamming his hat down vehemently upon his\nhead. “You ought to feel that such things are not flattering to say to a\nfellow.”</p>\n<p>“Should our whole intercourse consist of an exchange of compliments? Ma\nfoi!”</p>\n<p>“It isn't pleasant to have a woman tell you--” he went on, unheedingly,\nbut breaking off suddenly: “Now if I were like Arobin--you remember Alcee\nArobin and that story of the consul's wife at Biloxi?” And he related\nthe story of Alcee Arobin and the consul's wife; and another about the\ntenor of the French Opera, who received letters which should never\nhave been written; and still other stories, grave and gay, till Mrs.\nPontellier and her possible propensity for taking young men seriously\nwas apparently forgotten.</p>\n<p>Madame Ratignolle, when they had regained her cottage, went in to take\nthe hour's rest which she considered helpful. Before leaving her, Robert\nbegged her pardon for the impatience--he called it rudeness--with which\nhe had received her well-meant caution.</p>\n<p>“You made one mistake, Adele,” he said, with a light smile; “there is\nno earthly possibility of Mrs. Pontellier ever taking me seriously. You\nshould have warned me against taking myself seriously. Your advice might\nthen have carried some weight and given me subject for some reflection.\nAu revoir. But you look tired,” he added, solicitously. “Would you like\na cup of bouillon? Shall I stir you a toddy? Let me mix you a toddy with\na drop of Angostura.”</p>\n<p>She acceded to the suggestion of bouillon, which was grateful and\nacceptable. He went himself to the kitchen, which was a building apart\nfrom the cottages and lying to the rear of the house. And he himself\nbrought her the golden-brown bouillon, in a dainty Sevres cup, with a\nflaky cracker or two on the saucer.</p>\n<p>She thrust a bare, white arm from the curtain which shielded her open\ndoor, and received the cup from his hands. She told him he was a bon\ngarcon, and she meant it. Robert thanked her and turned away toward “the\nhouse.”</p>\n<p>The lovers were just entering the grounds of the pension. They were\nleaning toward each other as the wateroaks bent from the sea. There was\nnot a particle of earth beneath their feet. Their heads might have been\nturned upside-down, so absolutely did they tread upon blue ether. The\nlady in black, creeping behind them, looked a trifle paler and more\njaded than usual. There was no sign of Mrs. Pontellier and the children.\nRobert scanned the distance for any such apparition. They would\ndoubtless remain away till the dinner hour. The young man ascended to\nhis mother's room. It was situated at the top of the house, made up of\nodd angles and a queer, sloping ceiling. Two broad dormer windows looked\nout toward the Gulf, and as far across it as a man's eye might reach.\nThe furnishings of the room were light, cool, and practical.</p>\n<p>Madame Lebrun was busily engaged at the sewing-machine. A little black\ngirl sat on the floor, and with her hands worked the treadle of the\nmachine. The Creole woman does not take any chances which may be avoided\nof imperiling her health.</p>\n<p>Robert went over and seated himself on the broad sill of one of the\ndormer windows. He took a book from his pocket and began energetically\nto read it, judging by the precision and frequency with which he turned\nthe leaves. The sewing-machine made a resounding clatter in the room;\nit was of a ponderous, by-gone make. In the lulls, Robert and his mother\nexchanged bits of desultory conversation.</p>\n<p>“Where is Mrs. Pontellier?”</p>\n<p>“Down at the beach with the children.”</p>\n<p>“I promised to lend her the Goncourt. Don't forget to take it down when\nyou go; it's there on the bookshelf over the small table.” Clatter,\nclatter, clatter, bang! for the next five or eight minutes.</p>\n<p>“Where is Victor going with the rockaway?”</p>\n<p>“The rockaway? Victor?”</p>\n<p>“Yes; down there in front. He seems to be getting ready to drive away\nsomewhere.”</p>\n<p>“Call him.” Clatter, clatter!</p>\n<p>Robert uttered a shrill, piercing whistle which might have been heard\nback at the wharf.</p>\n<p>“He won't look up.”</p>\n<p>Madame Lebrun flew to the window. She called “Victor!” She waved a\nhandkerchief and called again. The young fellow below got into the\nvehicle and started the horse off at a gallop.</p>\n<p>Madame Lebrun went back to the machine, crimson with annoyance. Victor\nwas the younger son and brother--a tete montee, with a temper which\ninvited violence and a will which no ax could break.</p>\n<p>“Whenever you say the word I'm ready to thrash any amount of reason into\nhim that he's able to hold.”</p>\n<p>“If your father had only lived!” Clatter, clatter, clatter, clatter,\nbang! It was a fixed belief with Madame Lebrun that the conduct of the\nuniverse and all things pertaining thereto would have been manifestly of\na more intelligent and higher order had not Monsieur Lebrun been removed\nto other spheres during the early years of their married life.</p>\n<p>“What do you hear from Montel?” Montel was a middle-aged gentleman whose\nvain ambition and desire for the past twenty years had been to fill\nthe void which Monsieur Lebrun's taking off had left in the Lebrun\nhousehold. Clatter, clatter, bang, clatter!</p>\n<p>“I have a letter somewhere,” looking in the machine drawer and finding\nthe letter in the bottom of the workbasket. “He says to tell you he will\nbe in Vera Cruz the beginning of next month,”--clatter, clatter!--“and\nif you still have the intention of joining him”--bang! clatter, clatter,\nbang!</p>\n<p>“Why didn't you tell me so before, mother? You know I wanted--” Clatter,\nclatter, clatter!</p>\n<p>“Do you see Mrs. Pontellier starting back with the children? She will\nbe in late to luncheon again. She never starts to get ready for luncheon\ntill the last minute.” Clatter, clatter! “Where are you going?”</p>\n<p>“Where did you say the Goncourt was?”</p>\n<p>IX</p>\n<p>Every light in the hall was ablaze; every lamp turned as high as it\ncould be without smoking the chimney or threatening explosion. The lamps\nwere fixed at intervals against the wall, encircling the whole room.\nSome one had gathered orange and lemon branches, and with these\nfashioned graceful festoons between. The dark green of the branches\nstood out and glistened against the white muslin curtains which draped\nthe windows, and which puffed, floated, and flapped at the capricious\nwill of a stiff breeze that swept up from the Gulf.</p>\n<p>It was Saturday night a few weeks after the intimate conversation held\nbetween Robert and Madame Ratignolle on their way from the beach. An\nunusual number of husbands, fathers, and friends had come down to stay\nover Sunday; and they were being suitably entertained by their families,\nwith the material help of Madame Lebrun. The dining tables had all been\nremoved to one end of the hall, and the chairs ranged about in rows and\nin clusters. Each little family group had had its say and exchanged\nits domestic gossip earlier in the evening. There was now an apparent\ndisposition to relax; to widen the circle of confidences and give a more\ngeneral tone to the conversation.</p>\n<p>Many of the children had been permitted to sit up beyond their usual\nbedtime. A small band of them were lying on their stomachs on the floor\nlooking at the colored sheets of the comic papers which Mr. Pontellier\nhad brought down. The little Pontellier boys were permitting them to do\nso, and making their authority felt.</p>\n<p>Music, dancing, and a recitation or two were the entertainments\nfurnished, or rather, offered. But there was nothing systematic about\nthe programme, no appearance of prearrangement nor even premeditation.</p>\n<p>At an early hour in the evening the Farival twins were prevailed upon to\nplay the piano. They were girls of fourteen, always clad in the Virgin's\ncolors, blue and white, having been dedicated to the Blessed Virgin\nat their baptism. They played a duet from “Zampa,” and at the earnest\nsolicitation of every one present followed it with the overture to “The\nPoet and the Peasant.”</p>\n<p>“Allez vous-en! Sapristi!” shrieked the parrot outside the door. He was\nthe only being present who possessed sufficient candor to admit that he\nwas not listening to these gracious performances for the first time that\nsummer. Old Monsieur Farival, grandfather of the twins, grew indignant\nover the interruption, and insisted upon having the bird removed and\nconsigned to regions of darkness. Victor Lebrun objected; and his\ndecrees were as immutable as those of Fate. The parrot fortunately\noffered no further interruption to the entertainment, the whole venom\nof his nature apparently having been cherished up and hurled against the\ntwins in that one impetuous outburst.</p>\n<p>Later a young brother and sister gave recitations, which every one\npresent had heard many times at winter evening entertainments in the\ncity.</p>\n<p>A little girl performed a skirt dance in the center of the floor.\nThe mother played her accompaniments and at the same time watched her\ndaughter with greedy admiration and nervous apprehension. She need have\nhad no apprehension. The child was mistress of the situation. She had\nbeen properly dressed for the occasion in black tulle and black silk\ntights. Her little neck and arms were bare, and her hair, artificially\ncrimped, stood out like fluffy black plumes over her head. Her poses\nwere full of grace, and her little black-shod toes twinkled as they shot\nout and upward with a rapidity and suddenness which were bewildering.</p>\n<p>But there was no reason why every one should not dance. Madame\nRatignolle could not, so it was she who gaily consented to play for the\nothers. She played very well, keeping excellent waltz time and infusing\nan expression into the strains which was indeed inspiring. She was\nkeeping up her music on account of the children, she said; because she\nand her husband both considered it a means of brightening the home and\nmaking it attractive.</p>\n<p>Almost every one danced but the twins, who could not be induced to\nseparate during the brief period when one or the other should be\nwhirling around the room in the arms of a man. They might have danced\ntogether, but they did not think of it.</p>\n<p>The children were sent to bed. Some went submissively; others with\nshrieks and protests as they were dragged away. They had been permitted\nto sit up till after the ice-cream, which naturally marked the limit of\nhuman indulgence.</p>\n<p>The ice-cream was passed around with cake--gold and silver cake arranged\non platters in alternate slices; it had been made and frozen during the\nafternoon back of the kitchen by two black women, under the supervision\nof Victor. It was pronounced a great success--excellent if it had only\ncontained a little less vanilla or a little more sugar, if it had been\nfrozen a degree harder, and if the salt might have been kept out of\nportions of it. Victor was proud of his achievement, and went about\nrecommending it and urging every one to partake of it to excess.</p>\n<p>After Mrs. Pontellier had danced twice with her husband, once with\nRobert, and once with Monsieur Ratignolle, who was thin and tall and\nswayed like a reed in the wind when he danced, she went out on the\ngallery and seated herself on the low window-sill, where she commanded a\nview of all that went on in the hall and could look out toward the Gulf.\nThere was a soft effulgence in the east. The moon was coming up, and its\nmystic shimmer was casting a million lights across the distant, restless\nwater.</p>\n<p>“Would you like to hear Mademoiselle Reisz play?” asked Robert, coming\nout on the porch where she was. Of course Edna would like to hear\nMademoiselle Reisz play; but she feared it would be useless to entreat\nher.</p>\n<p>“I'll ask her,” he said. “I'll tell her that you want to hear her. She\nlikes you. She will come.” He turned and hurried away to one of the far\ncottages, where Mademoiselle Reisz was shuffling away. She was dragging\na chair in and out of her room, and at intervals objecting to the crying\nof a baby, which a nurse in the adjoining cottage was endeavoring to put\nto sleep. She was a disagreeable little woman, no longer young, who\nhad quarreled with almost every one, owing to a temper which was\nself-assertive and a disposition to trample upon the rights of others.\nRobert prevailed upon her without any too great difficulty.</p>\n<p>She entered the hall with him during a lull in the dance. She made an\nawkward, imperious little bow as she went in. She was a homely woman,\nwith a small weazened face and body and eyes that glowed. She had\nabsolutely no taste in dress, and wore a batch of rusty black lace with\na bunch of artificial violets pinned to the side of her hair.</p>\n<p>“Ask Mrs. Pontellier what she would like to hear me play,” she requested\nof Robert. She sat perfectly still before the piano, not touching the\nkeys, while Robert carried her message to Edna at the window. A general\nair of surprise and genuine satisfaction fell upon every one as they saw\nthe pianist enter. There was a settling down, and a prevailing air\nof expectancy everywhere. Edna was a trifle embarrassed at being thus\nsignaled out for the imperious little woman's favor. She would not dare\nto choose, and begged that Mademoiselle Reisz would please herself in\nher selections.</p>\n<p>Edna was what she herself called very fond of music. Musical strains,\nwell rendered, had a way of evoking pictures in her mind. She sometimes\nliked to sit in the room of mornings when Madame Ratignolle played\nor practiced. One piece which that lady played Edna had entitled\n“Solitude.” It was a short, plaintive, minor strain. The name of the\npiece was something else, but she called it “Solitude.” When she heard\nit there came before her imagination the figure of a man standing beside\na desolate rock on the seashore. He was naked. His attitude was one\nof hopeless resignation as he looked toward a distant bird winging its\nflight away from him.</p>\n<p>Another piece called to her mind a dainty young woman clad in an Empire\ngown, taking mincing dancing steps as she came down a long avenue\nbetween tall hedges. Again, another reminded her of children at play,\nand still another of nothing on earth but a demure lady stroking a cat.</p>\n<p>The very first chords which Mademoiselle Reisz struck upon the piano\nsent a keen tremor down Mrs. Pontellier's spinal column. It was not\nthe first time she had heard an artist at the piano. Perhaps it was the\nfirst time she was ready, perhaps the first time her being was tempered\nto take an impress of the abiding truth.</p>\n<p>She waited for the material pictures which she thought would gather and\nblaze before her imagination. She waited in vain. She saw no pictures\nof solitude, of hope, of longing, or of despair. But the very passions\nthemselves were aroused within her soul, swaying it, lashing it, as the\nwaves daily beat upon her splendid body. She trembled, she was choking,\nand the tears blinded her.</p>\n<p>Mademoiselle had finished. She arose, and bowing her stiff, lofty bow,\nshe went away, stopping for neither thanks nor applause. As she passed\nalong the gallery she patted Edna upon the shoulder.</p>\n<p>“Well, how did you like my music?” she asked. The young woman was\nunable to answer; she pressed the hand of the pianist convulsively.\nMademoiselle Reisz perceived her agitation and even her tears. She\npatted her again upon the shoulder as she said:</p>\n<p>“You are the only one worth playing for. Those others? Bah!” and she\nwent shuffling and sidling on down the gallery toward her room.</p>\n<p>But she was mistaken about “those others.” Her playing had aroused a\nfever of enthusiasm. “What passion!” “What an artist!” “I have always\nsaid no one could play Chopin like Mademoiselle Reisz!” “That last\nprelude! Bon Dieu! It shakes a man!”</p>\n<p>It was growing late, and there was a general disposition to disband. But\nsome one, perhaps it was Robert, thought of a bath at that mystic hour\nand under that mystic moon.</p>\n<p>X</p>\n<p>At all events Robert proposed it, and there was not a dissenting voice.\nThere was not one but was ready to follow when he led the way. He did\nnot lead the way, however, he directed the way; and he himself loitered\nbehind with the lovers, who had betrayed a disposition to linger and\nhold themselves apart. He walked between them, whether with malicious or\nmischievous intent was not wholly clear, even to himself.</p>\n<p>The Pontelliers and Ratignolles walked ahead; the women leaning upon the\narms of their husbands. Edna could hear Robert's voice behind them,\nand could sometimes hear what he said. She wondered why he did not join\nthem. It was unlike him not to. Of late he had sometimes held away from\nher for an entire day, redoubling his devotion upon the next and the\nnext, as though to make up for hours that had been lost. She missed him\nthe days when some pretext served to take him away from her, just as one\nmisses the sun on a cloudy day without having thought much about the sun\nwhen it was shining.</p>\n<p>The people walked in little groups toward the beach. They talked and\nlaughed; some of them sang. There was a band playing down at Klein's\nhotel, and the strains reached them faintly, tempered by the distance.\nThere were strange, rare odors abroad--a tangle of the sea smell and of\nweeds and damp, new-plowed earth, mingled with the heavy perfume of a\nfield of white blossoms somewhere near. But the night sat lightly upon\nthe sea and the land. There was no weight of darkness; there were no\nshadows. The white light of the moon had fallen upon the world like the\nmystery and the softness of sleep.</p>\n<p>Most of them walked into the water as though into a native element. The\nsea was quiet now, and swelled lazily in broad billows that melted into\none another and did not break except upon the beach in little foamy\ncrests that coiled back like slow, white serpents.</p>\n<p>Edna had attempted all summer to learn to swim. She had received\ninstructions from both the men and women; in some instances from the\nchildren. Robert had pursued a system of lessons almost daily; and he\nwas nearly at the point of discouragement in realizing the futility of\nhis efforts. A certain ungovernable dread hung about her when in the\nwater, unless there was a hand near by that might reach out and reassure\nher.</p>\n<p>But that night she was like the little tottering, stumbling, clutching\nchild, who of a sudden realizes its powers, and walks for the first time\nalone, boldly and with over-confidence. She could have shouted for joy.\nShe did shout for joy, as with a sweeping stroke or two she lifted her\nbody to the surface of the water.</p>\n<p>A feeling of exultation overtook her, as if some power of significant\nimport had been given her to control the working of her body and her\nsoul. She grew daring and reckless, overestimating her strength. She\nwanted to swim far out, where no woman had swum before.</p>\n<p>Her unlooked-for achievement was the subject of wonder, applause, and\nadmiration. Each one congratulated himself that his special teachings\nhad accomplished this desired end.</p>\n<p>“How easy it is!” she thought. “It is nothing,” she said aloud; “why did\nI not discover before that it was nothing. Think of the time I have lost\nsplashing about like a baby!” She would not join the groups in their\nsports and bouts, but intoxicated with her newly conquered power, she\nswam out alone.</p>\n<p>She turned her face seaward to gather in an impression of space and\nsolitude, which the vast expanse of water, meeting and melting with the\nmoonlit sky, conveyed to her excited fancy. As she swam she seemed to be\nreaching out for the unlimited in which to lose herself.</p>\n<p>Once she turned and looked toward the shore, toward the people she had\nleft there. She had not gone any great distance--that is, what would\nhave been a great distance for an experienced swimmer. But to her\nunaccustomed vision the stretch of water behind her assumed the aspect\nof a barrier which her unaided strength would never be able to overcome.</p>\n<p>A quick vision of death smote her soul, and for a second of time\nappalled and enfeebled her senses. But by an effort she rallied her\nstaggering faculties and managed to regain the land.</p>\n<p>She made no mention of her encounter with death and her flash of terror,\nexcept to say to her husband, “I thought I should have perished out\nthere alone.”</p>\n<p>“You were not so very far, my dear; I was watching you,” he told her.</p>\n<p>Edna went at once to the bath-house, and she had put on her dry clothes\nand was ready to return home before the others had left the water. She\nstarted to walk away alone. They all called to her and shouted to her.\nShe waved a dissenting hand, and went on, paying no further heed to\ntheir renewed cries which sought to detain her.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes I am tempted to think that Mrs. Pontellier is capricious,”\nsaid Madame Lebrun, who was amusing herself immensely and feared that\nEdna's abrupt departure might put an end to the pleasure.</p>\n<p>“I know she is,” assented Mr. Pontellier; “sometimes, not often.”</p>\n<p>Edna had not traversed a quarter of the distance on her way home before\nshe was overtaken by Robert.</p>\n<p>“Did you think I was afraid?” she asked him, without a shade of\nannoyance.</p>\n<p>“No; I knew you weren't afraid.”</p>\n<p>“Then why did you come? Why didn't you stay out there with the others?”</p>\n<p>“I never thought of it.”</p>\n<p>“Thought of what?”</p>\n<p>“Of anything. What difference does it make?”</p>\n<p>“I'm very tired,” she uttered, complainingly.</p>\n<p>“I know you are.”</p>\n<p>“You don't know anything about it. Why should you know? I never was so\nexhausted in my life. But it isn't unpleasant. A thousand emotions have\nswept through me to-night. I don't comprehend half of them. Don't mind\nwhat I'm saying; I am just thinking aloud. I wonder if I shall ever\nbe stirred again as Mademoiselle Reisz's playing moved me to-night. I\nwonder if any night on earth will ever again be like this one. It is\nlike a night in a dream. The people about me are like some uncanny,\nhalf-human beings. There must be spirits abroad to-night.”</p>\n<p>“There are,” whispered Robert, “Didn't you know this was the\ntwenty-eighth of August?”</p>\n<p>“The twenty-eighth of August?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. On the twenty-eighth of August, at the hour of midnight, and if\nthe moon is shining--the moon must be shining--a spirit that has haunted\nthese shores for ages rises up from the Gulf. With its own penetrating\nvision the spirit seeks some one mortal worthy to hold him\ncompany, worthy of being exalted for a few hours into realms of the\nsemi-celestials. His search has always hitherto been fruitless, and he\nhas sunk back, disheartened, into the sea. But to-night he found Mrs.\nPontellier. Perhaps he will never wholly release her from the spell.\nPerhaps she will never again suffer a poor, unworthy earthling to walk\nin the shadow of her divine presence.”</p>\n<p>“Don't banter me,” she said, wounded at what appeared to be his\nflippancy. He did not mind the entreaty, but the tone with its delicate\nnote of pathos was like a reproach. He could not explain; he could not\ntell her that he had penetrated her mood and understood. He said\nnothing except to offer her his arm, for, by her own admission, she\nwas exhausted. She had been walking alone with her arms hanging limp,\nletting her white skirts trail along the dewy path. She took his arm,\nbut she did not lean upon it. She let her hand lie listlessly, as though\nher thoughts were elsewhere--somewhere in advance of her body, and she\nwas striving to overtake them.</p>\n<p>Robert assisted her into the hammock which swung from the post before\nher door out to the trunk of a tree.</p>\n<p>“Will you stay out here and wait for Mr. Pontellier?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“I'll stay out here. Good-night.”</p>\n<p>“Shall I get you a pillow?”</p>\n<p>“There's one here,” she said, feeling about, for they were in the\nshadow.</p>\n<p>“It must be soiled; the children have been tumbling it about.”</p>\n<p>“No matter.” And having discovered the pillow, she adjusted it beneath\nher head. She extended herself in the hammock with a deep breath of\nrelief. She was not a supercilious or an over-dainty woman. She was not\nmuch given to reclining in the hammock, and when she did so it was with\nno cat-like suggestion of voluptuous ease, but with a beneficent repose\nwhich seemed to invade her whole body.</p>\n<p>“Shall I stay with you till Mr. Pontellier comes?” asked Robert, seating\nhimself on the outer edge of one of the steps and taking hold of the\nhammock rope which was fastened to the post.</p>\n<p>“If you wish. Don't swing the hammock. Will you get my white shawl which\nI left on the window-sill over at the house?”</p>\n<p>“Are you chilly?”</p>\n<p>“No; but I shall be presently.”</p>\n<p>“Presently?” he laughed. “Do you know what time it is? How long are you\ngoing to stay out here?”</p>\n<p>“I don't know. Will you get the shawl?”</p>\n<p>“Of course I will,” he said, rising. He went over to the house, walking\nalong the grass. She watched his figure pass in and out of the strips of\nmoonlight. It was past midnight. It was very quiet.</p>\n<p>When he returned with the shawl she took it and kept it in her hand. She\ndid not put it around her.</p>\n<p>“Did you say I should stay till Mr. Pontellier came back?”</p>\n<p>“I said you might if you wished to.”</p>\n<p>He seated himself again and rolled a cigarette, which he smoked in\nsilence. Neither did Mrs. Pontellier speak. No multitude of words\ncould have been more significant than those moments of silence, or more\npregnant with the first-felt throbbings of desire.</p>\n<p>When the voices of the bathers were heard approaching, Robert said\ngood-night. She did not answer him. He thought she was asleep. Again\nshe watched his figure pass in and out of the strips of moonlight as he\nwalked away.</p>\n<p>XI</p>\n<p>“What are you doing out here, Edna? I thought I should find you in bed,”\nsaid her husband, when he discovered her lying there. He had walked up\nwith Madame Lebrun and left her at the house. His wife did not reply.</p>\n<p>“Are you asleep?” he asked, bending down close to look at her.</p>\n<p>“No.” Her eyes gleamed bright and intense, with no sleepy shadows, as\nthey looked into his.</p>\n<p>“Do you know it is past one o'clock? Come on,” and he mounted the steps\nand went into their room.</p>\n<p>“Edna!” called Mr. Pontellier from within, after a few moments had gone\nby.</p>\n<p>“Don't wait for me,” she answered. He thrust his head through the door.</p>\n<p>“You will take cold out there,” he said, irritably. “What folly is this?\nWhy don't you come in?”</p>\n<p>“It isn't cold; I have my shawl.”</p>\n<p>“The mosquitoes will devour you.”</p>\n<p>“There are no mosquitoes.”</p>\n<p>She heard him moving about the room; every sound indicating impatience\nand irritation. Another time she would have gone in at his request. She\nwould, through habit, have yielded to his desire; not with any sense of\nsubmission or obedience to his compelling wishes, but unthinkingly, as\nwe walk, move, sit, stand, go through the daily treadmill of the life\nwhich has been portioned out to us.</p>\n<p>“Edna, dear, are you not coming in soon?” he asked again, this time\nfondly, with a note of entreaty.</p>\n<p>“No; I am going to stay out here.”</p>\n<p>“This is more than folly,” he blurted out. “I can't permit you to stay\nout there all night. You must come in the house instantly.”</p>\n<p>With a writhing motion she settled herself more securely in the hammock.\nShe perceived that her will had blazed up, stubborn and resistant. She\ncould not at that moment have done other than denied and resisted. She\nwondered if her husband had ever spoken to her like that before, and if\nshe had submitted to his command. Of course she had; she remembered that\nshe had. But she could not realize why or how she should have yielded,\nfeeling as she then did.</p>\n<p>“Leonce, go to bed,” she said, “I mean to stay out here. I don't wish to\ngo in, and I don't intend to. Don't speak to me like that again; I shall\nnot answer you.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Pontellier had prepared for bed, but he slipped on an extra garment.\nHe opened a bottle of wine, of which he kept a small and select supply\nin a buffet of his own. He drank a glass of the wine and went out on the\ngallery and offered a glass to his wife. She did not wish any. He drew\nup the rocker, hoisted his slippered feet on the rail, and proceeded\nto smoke a cigar. He smoked two cigars; then he went inside and drank\nanother glass of wine. Mrs. Pontellier again declined to accept a glass\nwhen it was offered to her. Mr. Pontellier once more seated himself with\nelevated feet, and after a reasonable interval of time smoked some more\ncigars.</p>\n<p>Edna began to feel like one who awakens gradually out of a dream, a\ndelicious, grotesque, impossible dream, to feel again the realities\npressing into her soul. The physical need for sleep began to overtake\nher; the exuberance which had sustained and exalted her spirit left her\nhelpless and yielding to the conditions which crowded her in.</p>\n<p>The stillest hour of the night had come, the hour before dawn, when the\nworld seems to hold its breath. The moon hung low, and had turned from\nsilver to copper in the sleeping sky. The old owl no longer hooted, and\nthe water-oaks had ceased to moan as they bent their heads.</p>\n<p>Edna arose, cramped from lying so long and still in the hammock. She\ntottered up the steps, clutching feebly at the post before passing into\nthe house.</p>\n<p>“Are you coming in, Leonce?” she asked, turning her face toward her\nhusband.</p>\n<p>“Yes, dear,” he answered, with a glance following a misty puff of smoke.\n“Just as soon as I have finished my cigar.”</p>\n<p>XII</p>\n<p>She slept but a few hours. They were troubled and feverish hours,\ndisturbed with dreams that were intangible, that eluded her, leaving\nonly an impression upon her half-awakened senses of something\nunattainable. She was up and dressed in the cool of the early morning.\nThe air was invigorating and steadied somewhat her faculties. However,\nshe was not seeking refreshment or help from any source, either external\nor from within. She was blindly following whatever impulse moved her,\nas if she had placed herself in alien hands for direction, and freed her\nsoul of responsibility.</p>\n<p>Most of the people at that early hour were still in bed and asleep.\nA few, who intended to go over to the Cheniere for mass, were moving\nabout. The lovers, who had laid their plans the night before, were\nalready strolling toward the wharf. The lady in black, with her Sunday\nprayer-book, velvet and gold-clasped, and her Sunday silver beads, was\nfollowing them at no great distance. Old Monsieur Farival was up, and\nwas more than half inclined to do anything that suggested itself. He\nput on his big straw hat, and taking his umbrella from the stand in the\nhall, followed the lady in black, never overtaking her.</p>\n<p>The little negro girl who worked Madame Lebrun's sewing-machine was\nsweeping the galleries with long, absent-minded strokes of the broom.\nEdna sent her up into the house to awaken Robert.</p>\n<p>“Tell him I am going to the Cheniere. The boat is ready; tell him to\nhurry.”</p>\n<p>He had soon joined her. She had never sent for him before. She had never\nasked for him. She had never seemed to want him before. She did not\nappear conscious that she had done anything unusual in commanding\nhis presence. He was apparently equally unconscious of anything\nextraordinary in the situation. But his face was suffused with a quiet\nglow when he met her.</p>\n<p>They went together back to the kitchen to drink coffee. There was no\ntime to wait for any nicety of service. They stood outside the window\nand the cook passed them their coffee and a roll, which they drank and\nate from the window-sill. Edna said it tasted good.</p>\n<p>She had not thought of coffee nor of anything. He told her he had often\nnoticed that she lacked forethought.</p>\n<p>“Wasn't it enough to think of going to the Cheniere and waking you up?”\nshe laughed. “Do I have to think of everything?--as Leonce says when\nhe's in a bad humor. I don't blame him; he'd never be in a bad humor if\nit weren't for me.”</p>\n<p>They took a short cut across the sands. At a distance they could see\nthe curious procession moving toward the wharf--the lovers, shoulder to\nshoulder, creeping; the lady in black, gaining steadily upon them; old\nMonsieur Farival, losing ground inch by inch, and a young barefooted\nSpanish girl, with a red kerchief on her head and a basket on her arm,\nbringing up the rear.</p>\n<p>Robert knew the girl, and he talked to her a little in the boat. No one\npresent understood what they said. Her name was Mariequita. She had a\nround, sly, piquant face and pretty black eyes. Her hands were small,\nand she kept them folded over the handle of her basket. Her feet were\nbroad and coarse. She did not strive to hide them. Edna looked at her\nfeet, and noticed the sand and slime between her brown toes.</p>\n<p>Beaudelet grumbled because Mariequita was there, taking up so much room.\nIn reality he was annoyed at having old Monsieur Farival, who considered\nhimself the better sailor of the two. But he would not quarrel with\nso old a man as Monsieur Farival, so he quarreled with Mariequita. The\ngirl was deprecatory at one moment, appealing to Robert. She was saucy\nthe next, moving her head up and down, making “eyes” at Robert and\nmaking “mouths” at Beaudelet.</p>\n<p>The lovers were all alone. They saw nothing, they heard nothing. The\nlady in black was counting her beads for the third time. Old Monsieur\nFarival talked incessantly of what he knew about handling a boat, and of\nwhat Beaudelet did not know on the same subject.</p>\n<p>Edna liked it all. She looked Mariequita up and down, from her ugly\nbrown toes to her pretty black eyes, and back again.</p>\n<p>“Why does she look at me like that?” inquired the girl of Robert.</p>\n<p>“Maybe she thinks you are pretty. Shall I ask her?”</p>\n<p>“No. Is she your sweetheart?”</p>\n<p>“She's a married lady, and has two children.”</p>\n<p>“Oh! well! Francisco ran away with Sylvano's wife, who had four\nchildren. They took all his money and one of the children and stole his\nboat.”</p>\n<p>“Shut up!”</p>\n<p>“Does she understand?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, hush!”</p>\n<p>“Are those two married over there--leaning on each other?”</p>\n<p>“Of course not,” laughed Robert.</p>\n<p>“Of course not,” echoed Mariequita, with a serious, confirmatory bob of\nthe head.</p>\n<p>The sun was high up and beginning to bite. The swift breeze seemed\nto Edna to bury the sting of it into the pores of her face and hands.\nRobert held his umbrella over her. As they went cutting sidewise through\nthe water, the sails bellied taut, with the wind filling and overflowing\nthem. Old Monsieur Farival laughed sardonically at something as he\nlooked at the sails, and Beaudelet swore at the old man under his\nbreath.</p>\n<p>Sailing across the bay to the Cheniere Caminada, Edna felt as if she\nwere being borne away from some anchorage which had held her fast, whose\nchains had been loosening--had snapped the night before when the mystic\nspirit was abroad, leaving her free to drift whithersoever she chose\nto set her sails. Robert spoke to her incessantly; he no longer noticed\nMariequita. The girl had shrimps in her bamboo basket. They were covered\nwith Spanish moss. She beat the moss down impatiently, and muttered to\nherself sullenly.</p>\n<p>“Let us go to Grande Terre to-morrow?” said Robert in a low voice.</p>\n<p>“What shall we do there?”</p>\n<p>“Climb up the hill to the old fort and look at the little wriggling gold\nsnakes, and watch the lizards sun themselves.”</p>\n<p>She gazed away toward Grande Terre and thought she would like to be\nalone there with Robert, in the sun, listening to the ocean's roar and\nwatching the slimy lizards writhe in and out among the ruins of the old\nfort.</p>\n<p>“And the next day or the next we can sail to the Bayou Brulow,” he went\non.</p>\n<p>“What shall we do there?”</p>\n<p>“Anything--cast bait for fish.”</p>\n<p>“No; we'll go back to Grande Terre. Let the fish alone.”</p>\n<p>“We'll go wherever you like,” he said. “I'll have Tonie come over and\nhelp me patch and trim my boat. We shall not need Beaudelet nor any one.\nAre you afraid of the pirogue?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, no.”</p>\n<p>“Then I'll take you some night in the pirogue when the moon shines.\nMaybe your Gulf spirit will whisper to you in which of these islands the\ntreasures are hidden--direct you to the very spot, perhaps.”</p>\n<p>“And in a day we should be rich!” she laughed. “I'd give it all to you,\nthe pirate gold and every bit of treasure we could dig up. I think you\nwould know how to spend it. Pirate gold isn't a thing to be hoarded or\nutilized. It is something to squander and throw to the four winds, for\nthe fun of seeing the golden specks fly.”</p>\n<p>“We'd share it, and scatter it together,” he said. His face flushed.</p>\n<p>They all went together up to the quaint little Gothic church of Our Lady\nof Lourdes, gleaming all brown and yellow with paint in the sun's glare.</p>\n<p>Only Beaudelet remained behind, tinkering at his boat, and Mariequita\nwalked away with her basket of shrimps, casting a look of childish ill\nhumor and reproach at Robert from the corner of her eye.</p>\n<p>XIII</p>\n<p>A feeling of oppression and drowsiness overcame Edna during the service.\nHer head began to ache, and the lights on the altar swayed before\nher eyes. Another time she might have made an effort to regain her\ncomposure; but her one thought was to quit the stifling atmosphere of\nthe church and reach the open air. She arose, climbing over Robert's\nfeet with a muttered apology. Old Monsieur Farival, flurried, curious,\nstood up, but upon seeing that Robert had followed Mrs. Pontellier, he\nsank back into his seat. He whispered an anxious inquiry of the lady in\nblack, who did not notice him or reply, but kept her eyes fastened upon\nthe pages of her velvet prayer-book.</p>\n<p>“I felt giddy and almost overcome,” Edna said, lifting her hands\ninstinctively to her head and pushing her straw hat up from her\nforehead. “I couldn't have stayed through the service.” They were\noutside in the shadow of the church. Robert was full of solicitude.</p>\n<p>“It was folly to have thought of going in the first place, let alone\nstaying. Come over to Madame Antoine's; you can rest there.” He took her\narm and led her away, looking anxiously and continuously down into her\nface.</p>\n<p>How still it was, with only the voice of the sea whispering through the\nreeds that grew in the salt-water pools! The long line of little gray,\nweather-beaten houses nestled peacefully among the orange trees. It must\nalways have been God's day on that low, drowsy island, Edna thought.\nThey stopped, leaning over a jagged fence made of sea-drift, to ask\nfor water. A youth, a mild-faced Acadian, was drawing water from the\ncistern, which was nothing more than a rusty buoy, with an opening on\none side, sunk in the ground. The water which the youth handed to them\nin a tin pail was not cold to taste, but it was cool to her heated face,\nand it greatly revived and refreshed her.</p>\n<p>Madame Antoine's cot was at the far end of the village. She welcomed\nthem with all the native hospitality, as she would have opened her door\nto let the sunlight in. She was fat, and walked heavily and clumsily\nacross the floor. She could speak no English, but when Robert made her\nunderstand that the lady who accompanied him was ill and desired to\nrest, she was all eagerness to make Edna feel at home and to dispose of\nher comfortably.</p>\n<p>The whole place was immaculately clean, and the big, four-posted bed,\nsnow-white, invited one to repose. It stood in a small side room which\nlooked out across a narrow grass plot toward the shed, where there was a\ndisabled boat lying keel upward.</p>\n<p>Madame Antoine had not gone to mass. Her son Tonie had, but she supposed\nhe would soon be back, and she invited Robert to be seated and wait for\nhim. But he went and sat outside the door and smoked. Madame Antoine\nbusied herself in the large front room preparing dinner. She was boiling\nmullets over a few red coals in the huge fireplace.</p>\n<p>Edna, left alone in the little side room, loosened her clothes, removing\nthe greater part of them. She bathed her face, her neck and arms in\nthe basin that stood between the windows. She took off her shoes and\nstockings and stretched herself in the very center of the high, white\nbed. How luxurious it felt to rest thus in a strange, quaint bed,\nwith its sweet country odor of laurel lingering about the sheets and\nmattress! She stretched her strong limbs that ached a little. She ran\nher fingers through her loosened hair for a while. She looked at her\nround arms as she held them straight up and rubbed them one after the\nother, observing closely, as if it were something she saw for the first\ntime, the fine, firm quality and texture of her flesh. She clasped her\nhands easily above her head, and it was thus she fell asleep.</p>\n<p>She slept lightly at first, half awake and drowsily attentive to the\nthings about her. She could hear Madame Antoine's heavy, scraping tread\nas she walked back and forth on the sanded floor. Some chickens were\nclucking outside the windows, scratching for bits of gravel in the\ngrass. Later she half heard the voices of Robert and Tonie talking under\nthe shed. She did not stir. Even her eyelids rested numb and heavily\nover her sleepy eyes. The voices went on--Tonie's slow, Acadian drawl,\nRobert's quick, soft, smooth French. She understood French imperfectly\nunless directly addressed, and the voices were only part of the other\ndrowsy, muffled sounds lulling her senses.</p>\n<p>When Edna awoke it was with the conviction that she had slept long and\nsoundly. The voices were hushed under the shed. Madame Antoine's step\nwas no longer to be heard in the adjoining room. Even the chickens had\ngone elsewhere to scratch and cluck. The mosquito bar was drawn over\nher; the old woman had come in while she slept and let down the bar.\nEdna arose quietly from the bed, and looking between the curtains of the\nwindow, she saw by the slanting rays of the sun that the afternoon was\nfar advanced. Robert was out there under the shed, reclining in the\nshade against the sloping keel of the overturned boat. He was reading\nfrom a book. Tonie was no longer with him. She wondered what had become\nof the rest of the party. She peeped out at him two or three times as\nshe stood washing herself in the little basin between the windows.</p>\n<p>Madame Antoine had laid some coarse, clean towels upon a chair, and had\nplaced a box of poudre de riz within easy reach. Edna dabbed the powder\nupon her nose and cheeks as she looked at herself closely in the little\ndistorted mirror which hung on the wall above the basin. Her eyes were\nbright and wide awake and her face glowed.</p>\n<p>When she had completed her toilet she walked into the adjoining room.\nShe was very hungry. No one was there. But there was a cloth spread upon\nthe table that stood against the wall, and a cover was laid for one,\nwith a crusty brown loaf and a bottle of wine beside the plate. Edna bit\na piece from the brown loaf, tearing it with her strong, white teeth.\nShe poured some of the wine into the glass and drank it down. Then she\nwent softly out of doors, and plucking an orange from the low-hanging\nbough of a tree, threw it at Robert, who did not know she was awake and\nup.</p>\n<p>An illumination broke over his whole face when he saw her and joined her\nunder the orange tree.</p>\n<p>“How many years have I slept?” she inquired. “The whole island seems\nchanged. A new race of beings must have sprung up, leaving only you and\nme as past relics. How many ages ago did Madame Antoine and Tonie die?\nand when did our people from Grand Isle disappear from the earth?”</p>\n<p>He familiarly adjusted a ruffle upon her shoulder.</p>\n<p>“You have slept precisely one hundred years. I was left here to guard\nyour slumbers; and for one hundred years I have been out under the shed\nreading a book. The only evil I couldn't prevent was to keep a broiled\nfowl from drying up.”</p>\n<p>“If it has turned to stone, still will I eat it,” said Edna, moving with\nhim into the house. “But really, what has become of Monsieur Farival and\nthe others?”</p>\n<p>“Gone hours ago. When they found that you were sleeping they thought\nit best not to awake you. Any way, I wouldn't have let them. What was I\nhere for?”</p>\n<p>“I wonder if Leonce will be uneasy!” she speculated, as she seated\nherself at table.</p>\n<p>“Of course not; he knows you are with me,” Robert replied, as he\nbusied himself among sundry pans and covered dishes which had been left\nstanding on the hearth.</p>\n<p>“Where are Madame Antoine and her son?” asked Edna.</p>\n<p>“Gone to Vespers, and to visit some friends, I believe. I am to take you\nback in Tonie's boat whenever you are ready to go.”</p>\n<p>He stirred the smoldering ashes till the broiled fowl began to sizzle\nafresh. He served her with no mean repast, dripping the coffee anew\nand sharing it with her. Madame Antoine had cooked little else than\nthe mullets, but while Edna slept Robert had foraged the island. He was\nchildishly gratified to discover her appetite, and to see the relish\nwith which she ate the food which he had procured for her.</p>\n<p>“Shall we go right away?” she asked, after draining her glass and\nbrushing together the crumbs of the crusty loaf.</p>\n<p>“The sun isn't as low as it will be in two hours,” he answered.</p>\n<p>“The sun will be gone in two hours.”</p>\n<p>“Well, let it go; who cares!”</p>\n<p>They waited a good while under the orange trees, till Madame Antoine\ncame back, panting, waddling, with a thousand apologies to explain\nher absence. Tonie did not dare to return. He was shy, and would not\nwillingly face any woman except his mother.</p>\n<p>It was very pleasant to stay there under the orange trees, while the sun\ndipped lower and lower, turning the western sky to flaming copper and\ngold. The shadows lengthened and crept out like stealthy, grotesque\nmonsters across the grass.</p>\n<p>Edna and Robert both sat upon the ground--that is, he lay upon the\nground beside her, occasionally picking at the hem of her muslin gown.</p>\n<p>Madame Antoine seated her fat body, broad and squat, upon a bench beside\nthe door. She had been talking all the afternoon, and had wound herself\nup to the storytelling pitch.</p>\n<p>And what stories she told them! But twice in her life she had left the\nCheniere Caminada, and then for the briefest span. All her years she\nhad squatted and waddled there upon the island, gathering legends of the\nBaratarians and the sea. The night came on, with the moon to lighten\nit. Edna could hear the whispering voices of dead men and the click of\nmuffled gold.</p>\n<p>When she and Robert stepped into Tonie's boat, with the red lateen sail,\nmisty spirit forms were prowling in the shadows and among the reeds, and\nupon the water were phantom ships, speeding to cover.</p>\n<p>XIV</p>\n<p>The youngest boy, Etienne, had been very naughty, Madame Ratignolle\nsaid, as she delivered him into the hands of his mother. He had been\nunwilling to go to bed and had made a scene; whereupon she had taken\ncharge of him and pacified him as well as she could. Raoul had been in\nbed and asleep for two hours.</p>\n<p>The youngster was in his long white nightgown, that kept tripping him\nup as Madame Ratignolle led him along by the hand. With the other chubby\nfist he rubbed his eyes, which were heavy with sleep and ill humor. Edna\ntook him in her arms, and seating herself in the rocker, began to coddle\nand caress him, calling him all manner of tender names, soothing him to\nsleep.</p>\n<p>It was not more than nine o'clock. No one had yet gone to bed but the\nchildren.</p>\n<p>Leonce had been very uneasy at first, Madame Ratignolle said, and had\nwanted to start at once for the Cheniere. But Monsieur Farival had\nassured him that his wife was only overcome with sleep and fatigue, that\nTonie would bring her safely back later in the day; and he had thus been\ndissuaded from crossing the bay. He had gone over to Klein's, looking\nup some cotton broker whom he wished to see in regard to securities,\nexchanges, stocks, bonds, or something of the sort, Madame Ratignolle\ndid not remember what. He said he would not remain away late. She\nherself was suffering from heat and oppression, she said. She carried\na bottle of salts and a large fan. She would not consent to remain\nwith Edna, for Monsieur Ratignolle was alone, and he detested above all\nthings to be left alone.</p>\n<p>When Etienne had fallen asleep Edna bore him into the back room, and\nRobert went and lifted the mosquito bar that she might lay the child\ncomfortably in his bed. The quadroon had vanished. When they emerged\nfrom the cottage Robert bade Edna good-night.</p>\n<p>“Do you know we have been together the whole livelong day, Robert--since\nearly this morning?” she said at parting.</p>\n<p>“All but the hundred years when you were sleeping. Goodnight.”</p>\n<p>He pressed her hand and went away in the direction of the beach. He did\nnot join any of the others, but walked alone toward the Gulf.</p>\n<p>Edna stayed outside, awaiting her husband's return. She had no desire\nto sleep or to retire; nor did she feel like going over to sit with the\nRatignolles, or to join Madame Lebrun and a group whose animated voices\nreached her as they sat in conversation before the house. She let her\nmind wander back over her stay at Grand Isle; and she tried to discover\nwherein this summer had been different from any and every other summer\nof her life. She could only realize that she herself--her present\nself--was in some way different from the other self. That she was seeing\nwith different eyes and making the acquaintance of new conditions\nin herself that colored and changed her environment, she did not yet\nsuspect.</p>\n<p>She wondered why Robert had gone away and left her. It did not occur to\nher to think he might have grown tired of being with her the livelong\nday. She was not tired, and she felt that he was not. She regretted that\nhe had gone. It was so much more natural to have him stay when he was\nnot absolutely required to leave her.</p>\n<p>As Edna waited for her husband she sang low a little song that Robert\nhad sung as they crossed the bay. It began with “Ah! Si tu savais,” and\nevery verse ended with “si tu savais.”</p>\n<p>Robert's voice was not pretentious. It was musical and true. The voice,\nthe notes, the whole refrain haunted her memory.</p>\n<p>XV</p>\n<p>When Edna entered the dining-room one evening a little late, as was her\nhabit, an unusually animated conversation seemed to be going on. Several\npersons were talking at once, and Victor's voice was predominating,\neven over that of his mother. Edna had returned late from her bath, had\ndressed in some haste, and her face was flushed. Her head, set off by\nher dainty white gown, suggested a rich, rare blossom. She took her seat\nat table between old Monsieur Farival and Madame Ratignolle.</p>\n<p>As she seated herself and was about to begin to eat her soup, which\nhad been served when she entered the room, several persons informed her\nsimultaneously that Robert was going to Mexico. She laid her spoon down\nand looked about her bewildered. He had been with her, reading to her\nall the morning, and had never even mentioned such a place as Mexico.\nShe had not seen him during the afternoon; she had heard some one say he\nwas at the house, upstairs with his mother. This she had thought nothing\nof, though she was surprised when he did not join her later in the\nafternoon, when she went down to the beach.</p>\n<p>She looked across at him, where he sat beside Madame Lebrun, who\npresided. Edna's face was a blank picture of bewilderment, which she\nnever thought of disguising. He lifted his eyebrows with the pretext\nof a smile as he returned her glance. He looked embarrassed and uneasy.\n“When is he going?” she asked of everybody in general, as if Robert were\nnot there to answer for himself.</p>\n<p>“To-night!” “This very evening!” “Did you ever!” “What possesses him!”\nwere some of the replies she gathered, uttered simultaneously in French\nand English.</p>\n<p>“Impossible!” she exclaimed. “How can a person start off from Grand Isle\nto Mexico at a moment's notice, as if he were going over to Klein's or\nto the wharf or down to the beach?”</p>\n<p>“I said all along I was going to Mexico; I've been saying so for years!”\ncried Robert, in an excited and irritable tone, with the air of a man\ndefending himself against a swarm of stinging insects.</p>\n<p>Madame Lebrun knocked on the table with her knife handle.</p>\n<p>“Please let Robert explain why he is going, and why he is going\nto-night,” she called out. “Really, this table is getting to be more and\nmore like Bedlam every day, with everybody talking at once. Sometimes--I\nhope God will forgive me--but positively, sometimes I wish Victor would\nlose the power of speech.”</p>\n<p>Victor laughed sardonically as he thanked his mother for her holy wish,\nof which he failed to see the benefit to anybody, except that it might\nafford her a more ample opportunity and license to talk herself.</p>\n<p>Monsieur Farival thought that Victor should have been taken out in\nmid-ocean in his earliest youth and drowned. Victor thought there would\nbe more logic in thus disposing of old people with an established claim\nfor making themselves universally obnoxious. Madame Lebrun grew a trifle\nhysterical; Robert called his brother some sharp, hard names.</p>\n<p>“There's nothing much to explain, mother,” he said; though he explained,\nnevertheless--looking chiefly at Edna--that he could only meet the\ngentleman whom he intended to join at Vera Cruz by taking such and such\na steamer, which left New Orleans on such a day; that Beaudelet was\ngoing out with his lugger-load of vegetables that night, which gave him\nan opportunity of reaching the city and making his vessel in time.</p>\n<p>“But when did you make up your mind to all this?” demanded Monsieur\nFarival.</p>\n<p>“This afternoon,” returned Robert, with a shade of annoyance.</p>\n<p>“At what time this afternoon?” persisted the old gentleman, with nagging\ndetermination, as if he were cross-questioning a criminal in a court of\njustice.</p>\n<p>“At four o'clock this afternoon, Monsieur Farival,” Robert replied, in\na high voice and with a lofty air, which reminded Edna of some gentleman\non the stage.</p>\n<p>She had forced herself to eat most of her soup, and now she was picking\nthe flaky bits of a court bouillon with her fork.</p>\n<p>The lovers were profiting by the general conversation on Mexico to speak\nin whispers of matters which they rightly considered were interesting\nto no one but themselves. The lady in black had once received a pair\nof prayer-beads of curious workmanship from Mexico, with very special\nindulgence attached to them, but she had never been able to ascertain\nwhether the indulgence extended outside the Mexican border. Father\nFochel of the Cathedral had attempted to explain it; but he had not\ndone so to her satisfaction. And she begged that Robert would interest\nhimself, and discover, if possible, whether she was entitled to the\nindulgence accompanying the remarkably curious Mexican prayer-beads.</p>\n<p>Madame Ratignolle hoped that Robert would exercise extreme caution\nin dealing with the Mexicans, who, she considered, were a treacherous\npeople, unscrupulous and revengeful. She trusted she did them no\ninjustice in thus condemning them as a race. She had known personally\nbut one Mexican, who made and sold excellent tamales, and whom she would\nhave trusted implicitly, so soft-spoken was he. One day he was arrested\nfor stabbing his wife. She never knew whether he had been hanged or not.</p>\n<p>Victor had grown hilarious, and was attempting to tell an anecdote\nabout a Mexican girl who served chocolate one winter in a restaurant in\nDauphine Street. No one would listen to him but old Monsieur Farival,\nwho went into convulsions over the droll story.</p>\n<p>Edna wondered if they had all gone mad, to be talking and clamoring at\nthat rate. She herself could think of nothing to say about Mexico or the\nMexicans.</p>\n<p>“At what time do you leave?” she asked Robert.</p>\n<p>“At ten,” he told her. “Beaudelet wants to wait for the moon.”</p>\n<p>“Are you all ready to go?”</p>\n<p>“Quite ready. I shall only take a hand-bag, and shall pack my trunk in\nthe city.”</p>\n<p>He turned to answer some question put to him by his mother, and Edna,\nhaving finished her black coffee, left the table.</p>\n<p>She went directly to her room. The little cottage was close and stuffy\nafter leaving the outer air. But she did not mind; there appeared to be\na hundred different things demanding her attention indoors. She began\nto set the toilet-stand to rights, grumbling at the negligence of the\nquadroon, who was in the adjoining room putting the children to bed.\nShe gathered together stray garments that were hanging on the backs of\nchairs, and put each where it belonged in closet or bureau drawer. She\nchanged her gown for a more comfortable and commodious wrapper. She\nrearranged her hair, combing and brushing it with unusual energy. Then\nshe went in and assisted the quadroon in getting the boys to bed.</p>\n<p>They were very playful and inclined to talk--to do anything but lie\nquiet and go to sleep. Edna sent the quadroon away to her supper and\ntold her she need not return. Then she sat and told the children\na story. Instead of soothing it excited them, and added to their\nwakefulness. She left them in heated argument, speculating about\nthe conclusion of the tale which their mother promised to finish the\nfollowing night.</p>\n<p>The little black girl came in to say that Madame Lebrun would like to\nhave Mrs. Pontellier go and sit with them over at the house till Mr.\nRobert went away. Edna returned answer that she had already undressed,\nthat she did not feel quite well, but perhaps she would go over to the\nhouse later. She started to dress again, and got as far advanced as to\nremove her peignoir. But changing her mind once more she resumed\nthe peignoir, and went outside and sat down before her door. She was\noverheated and irritable, and fanned herself energetically for a while.\nMadame Ratignolle came down to discover what was the matter.</p>\n<p>“All that noise and confusion at the table must have upset me,” replied\nEdna, “and moreover, I hate shocks and surprises. The idea of Robert\nstarting off in such a ridiculously sudden and dramatic way! As if\nit were a matter of life and death! Never saying a word about it all\nmorning when he was with me.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” agreed Madame Ratignolle. “I think it was showing us all--you\nespecially--very little consideration. It wouldn't have surprised me in\nany of the others; those Lebruns are all given to heroics. But I must\nsay I should never have expected such a thing from Robert. Are you not\ncoming down? Come on, dear; it doesn't look friendly.”</p>\n<p>“No,” said Edna, a little sullenly. “I can't go to the trouble of\ndressing again; I don't feel like it.”</p>\n<p>“You needn't dress; you look all right; fasten a belt around your waist.\nJust look at me!”</p>\n<p>“No,” persisted Edna; “but you go on. Madame Lebrun might be offended if\nwe both stayed away.”</p>\n<p>Madame Ratignolle kissed Edna good-night, and went away, being in truth\nrather desirous of joining in the general and animated conversation\nwhich was still in progress concerning Mexico and the Mexicans.</p>\n<p>Somewhat later Robert came up, carrying his hand-bag.</p>\n<p>“Aren't you feeling well?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“Oh, well enough. Are you going right away?”</p>\n<p>He lit a match and looked at his watch. “In twenty minutes,” he said.\nThe sudden and brief flare of the match emphasized the darkness for a\nwhile. He sat down upon a stool which the children had left out on the\nporch.</p>\n<p>“Get a chair,” said Edna.</p>\n<p>“This will do,” he replied. He put on his soft hat and nervously took it\noff again, and wiping his face with his handkerchief, complained of the\nheat.</p>\n<p>“Take the fan,” said Edna, offering it to him.</p>\n<p>“Oh, no! Thank you. It does no good; you have to stop fanning some time,\nand feel all the more uncomfortable afterward.”</p>\n<p>“That's one of the ridiculous things which men always say. I have never\nknown one to speak otherwise of fanning. How long will you be gone?”</p>\n<p>“Forever, perhaps. I don't know. It depends upon a good many things.”</p>\n<p>“Well, in case it shouldn't be forever, how long will it be?”</p>\n<p>“I don't know.”</p>\n<p>“This seems to me perfectly preposterous and uncalled for. I don't like\nit. I don't understand your motive for silence and mystery, never saying\na word to me about it this morning.” He remained silent, not offering to\ndefend himself. He only said, after a moment:</p>\n<p>“Don't part from me in any ill humor. I never knew you to be out of\npatience with me before.”</p>\n<p>“I don't want to part in any ill humor,” she said. “But can't you\nunderstand? I've grown used to seeing you, to having you with me all\nthe time, and your action seems unfriendly, even unkind. You don't even\noffer an excuse for it. Why, I was planning to be together, thinking of\nhow pleasant it would be to see you in the city next winter.”</p>\n<p>“So was I,” he blurted. “Perhaps that's the--” He stood up suddenly\nand held out his hand. “Good-by, my dear Mrs. Pontellier; good-by. You\nwon't--I hope you won't completely forget me.” She clung to his hand,\nstriving to detain him.</p>\n<p>“Write to me when you get there, won't you, Robert?” she entreated.</p>\n<p>“I will, thank you. Good-by.”</p>\n<p>How unlike Robert! The merest acquaintance would have said something\nmore emphatic than “I will, thank you; good-by,” to such a request.</p>\n<p>He had evidently already taken leave of the people over at the house,\nfor he descended the steps and went to join Beaudelet, who was out there\nwith an oar across his shoulder waiting for Robert. They walked away\nin the darkness. She could only hear Beaudelet's voice; Robert had\napparently not even spoken a word of greeting to his companion.</p>\n<p>Edna bit her handkerchief convulsively, striving to hold back and to\nhide, even from herself as she would have hidden from another, the\nemotion which was troubling--tearing--her. Her eyes were brimming with\ntears.</p>\n<p>For the first time she recognized the symptoms of infatuation which she\nhad felt incipiently as a child, as a girl in her earliest teens, and\nlater as a young woman. The recognition did not lessen the reality, the\npoignancy of the revelation by any suggestion or promise of instability.\nThe past was nothing to her; offered no lesson which she was willing to\nheed. The future was a mystery which she never attempted to penetrate.\nThe present alone was significant; was hers, to torture her as it was\ndoing then with the biting conviction that she had lost that which she\nhad held, that she had been denied that which her impassioned, newly\nawakened being demanded.</p>\n<p>XVI</p>\n<p>“Do you miss your friend greatly?” asked Mademoiselle Reisz one morning\nas she came creeping up behind Edna, who had just left her cottage on\nher way to the beach. She spent much of her time in the water since she\nhad acquired finally the art of swimming. As their stay at Grand Isle\ndrew near its close, she felt that she could not give too much time to a\ndiversion which afforded her the only real pleasurable moments that she\nknew. When Mademoiselle Reisz came and touched her upon the shoulder\nand spoke to her, the woman seemed to echo the thought which was ever in\nEdna's mind; or, better, the feeling which constantly possessed her.</p>\n<p>Robert's going had some way taken the brightness, the color, the meaning\nout of everything. The conditions of her life were in no way changed,\nbut her whole existence was dulled, like a faded garment which seems to\nbe no longer worth wearing. She sought him everywhere--in others whom\nshe induced to talk about him. She went up in the mornings to Madame\nLebrun's room, braving the clatter of the old sewing-machine. She sat\nthere and chatted at intervals as Robert had done. She gazed around\nthe room at the pictures and photographs hanging upon the wall, and\ndiscovered in some corner an old family album, which she examined with\nthe keenest interest, appealing to Madame Lebrun for enlightenment\nconcerning the many figures and faces which she discovered between its\npages.</p>\n<p>There was a picture of Madame Lebrun with Robert as a baby, seated in\nher lap, a round-faced infant with a fist in his mouth. The eyes alone\nin the baby suggested the man. And that was he also in kilts, at the age\nof five, wearing long curls and holding a whip in his hand. It made Edna\nlaugh, and she laughed, too, at the portrait in his first long trousers;\nwhile another interested her, taken when he left for college, looking\nthin, long-faced, with eyes full of fire, ambition and great intentions.\nBut there was no recent picture, none which suggested the Robert who had\ngone away five days ago, leaving a void and wilderness behind him.</p>\n<p>“Oh, Robert stopped having his pictures taken when he had to pay for\nthem himself! He found wiser use for his money, he says,” explained\nMadame Lebrun. She had a letter from him, written before he left New\nOrleans. Edna wished to see the letter, and Madame Lebrun told her to\nlook for it either on the table or the dresser, or perhaps it was on the\nmantelpiece.</p>\n<p>The letter was on the bookshelf. It possessed the greatest interest and\nattraction for Edna; the envelope, its size and shape, the post-mark,\nthe handwriting. She examined every detail of the outside before opening\nit. There were only a few lines, setting forth that he would leave the\ncity that afternoon, that he had packed his trunk in good shape, that\nhe was well, and sent her his love and begged to be affectionately\nremembered to all. There was no special message to Edna except a\npostscript saying that if Mrs. Pontellier desired to finish the book\nwhich he had been reading to her, his mother would find it in his\nroom, among other books there on the table. Edna experienced a pang of\njealousy because he had written to his mother rather than to her.</p>\n<p>Every one seemed to take for granted that she missed him. Even her\nhusband, when he came down the Saturday following Robert's departure,\nexpressed regret that he had gone.</p>\n<p>“How do you get on without him, Edna?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“It's very dull without him,” she admitted. Mr. Pontellier had seen\nRobert in the city, and Edna asked him a dozen questions or more. Where\nhad they met? On Carondelet Street, in the morning. They had gone\n“in” and had a drink and a cigar together. What had they talked about?\nChiefly about his prospects in Mexico, which Mr. Pontellier thought\nwere promising. How did he look? How did he seem--grave, or gay, or how?\nQuite cheerful, and wholly taken up with the idea of his trip, which\nMr. Pontellier found altogether natural in a young fellow about to seek\nfortune and adventure in a strange, queer country.</p>\n<p>Edna tapped her foot impatiently, and wondered why the children\npersisted in playing in the sun when they might be under the trees. She\nwent down and led them out of the sun, scolding the quadroon for not\nbeing more attentive.</p>\n<p>It did not strike her as in the least grotesque that she should be\nmaking of Robert the object of conversation and leading her husband to\nspeak of him. The sentiment which she entertained for Robert in no way\nresembled that which she felt for her husband, or had ever felt, or ever\nexpected to feel. She had all her life long been accustomed to harbor\nthoughts and emotions which never voiced themselves. They had never\ntaken the form of struggles. They belonged to her and were her own, and\nshe entertained the conviction that she had a right to them and that\nthey concerned no one but herself. Edna had once told Madame Ratignolle\nthat she would never sacrifice herself for her children, or for any one.\nThen had followed a rather heated argument; the two women did not appear\nto understand each other or to be talking the same language. Edna tried\nto appease her friend, to explain.</p>\n<p>“I would give up the unessential; I would give my money, I would give my\nlife for my children; but I wouldn't give myself. I can't make it more\nclear; it's only something which I am beginning to comprehend, which is\nrevealing itself to me.”</p>\n<p>“I don't know what you would call the essential, or what you mean by the\nunessential,” said Madame Ratignolle, cheerfully; “but a woman who would\ngive her life for her children could do no more than that--your Bible\ntells you so. I'm sure I couldn't do more than that.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes you could!” laughed Edna.</p>\n<p>She was not surprised at Mademoiselle Reisz's question the morning that\nlady, following her to the beach, tapped her on the shoulder and asked\nif she did not greatly miss her young friend.</p>\n<p>“Oh, good morning, Mademoiselle; is it you? Why, of course I miss\nRobert. Are you going down to bathe?”</p>\n<p>“Why should I go down to bathe at the very end of the season when I\nhaven't been in the surf all summer,” replied the woman, disagreeably.</p>\n<p>“I beg your pardon,” offered Edna, in some embarrassment, for she should\nhave remembered that Mademoiselle Reisz's avoidance of the water had\nfurnished a theme for much pleasantry. Some among them thought it was\non account of her false hair, or the dread of getting the violets wet,\nwhile others attributed it to the natural aversion for water sometimes\nbelieved to accompany the artistic temperament. Mademoiselle offered\nEdna some chocolates in a paper bag, which she took from her pocket,\nby way of showing that she bore no ill feeling. She habitually ate\nchocolates for their sustaining quality; they contained much nutriment\nin small compass, she said. They saved her from starvation, as Madame\nLebrun's table was utterly impossible; and no one save so impertinent a\nwoman as Madame Lebrun could think of offering such food to people and\nrequiring them to pay for it.</p>\n<p>“She must feel very lonely without her son,” said Edna, desiring to\nchange the subject. “Her favorite son, too. It must have been quite hard\nto let him go.”</p>\n<p>Mademoiselle laughed maliciously.</p>\n<p>“Her favorite son! Oh, dear! Who could have been imposing such a tale\nupon you? Aline Lebrun lives for Victor, and for Victor alone. She has\nspoiled him into the worthless creature he is. She worships him and the\nground he walks on. Robert is very well in a way, to give up all the\nmoney he can earn to the family, and keep the barest pittance for\nhimself. Favorite son, indeed! I miss the poor fellow myself, my dear. I\nliked to see him and to hear him about the place the only Lebrun who is\nworth a pinch of salt. He comes to see me often in the city. I like\nto play to him. That Victor! hanging would be too good for him. It's a\nwonder Robert hasn't beaten him to death long ago.”</p>\n<p>“I thought he had great patience with his brother,” offered Edna, glad\nto be talking about Robert, no matter what was said.</p>\n<p>“Oh! he thrashed him well enough a year or two ago,” said Mademoiselle.\n“It was about a Spanish girl, whom Victor considered that he had some\nsort of claim upon. He met Robert one day talking to the girl, or\nwalking with her, or bathing with her, or carrying her basket--I don't\nremember what;--and he became so insulting and abusive that Robert gave\nhim a thrashing on the spot that has kept him comparatively in order for\na good while. It's about time he was getting another.”</p>\n<p>“Was her name Mariequita?” asked Edna.</p>\n<p>“Mariequita--yes, that was it; Mariequita. I had forgotten. Oh, she's a\nsly one, and a bad one, that Mariequita!”</p>\n<p>Edna looked down at Mademoiselle Reisz and wondered how she could have\nlistened to her venom so long. For some reason she felt depressed,\nalmost unhappy. She had not intended to go into the water; but she\ndonned her bathing suit, and left Mademoiselle alone, seated under the\nshade of the children's tent. The water was growing cooler as the season\nadvanced. Edna plunged and swam about with an abandon that thrilled and\ninvigorated her. She remained a long time in the water, half hoping that\nMademoiselle Reisz would not wait for her.</p>\n<p>But Mademoiselle waited. She was very amiable during the walk back, and\nraved much over Edna's appearance in her bathing suit. She talked about\nmusic. She hoped that Edna would go to see her in the city, and wrote\nher address with the stub of a pencil on a piece of card which she found\nin her pocket.</p>\n<p>“When do you leave?” asked Edna.</p>\n<p>“Next Monday; and you?”</p>\n<p>“The following week,” answered Edna, adding, “It has been a pleasant\nsummer, hasn't it, Mademoiselle?”</p>\n<p>“Well,” agreed Mademoiselle Reisz, with a shrug, “rather pleasant, if it\nhadn't been for the mosquitoes and the Farival twins.”</p>\n<p>XVII</p>\n<p>The Pontelliers possessed a very charming home on Esplanade Street in\nNew Orleans. It was a large, double cottage, with a broad front veranda,\nwhose round, fluted columns supported the sloping roof. The house was\npainted a dazzling white; the outside shutters, or jalousies, were\ngreen. In the yard, which was kept scrupulously neat, were flowers and\nplants of every description which flourishes in South Louisiana. Within\ndoors the appointments were perfect after the conventional type. The\nsoftest carpets and rugs covered the floors; rich and tasteful draperies\nhung at doors and windows. There were paintings, selected with judgment\nand discrimination, upon the walls. The cut glass, the silver, the heavy\ndamask which daily appeared upon the table were the envy of many women\nwhose husbands were less generous than Mr. Pontellier.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pontellier was very fond of walking about his house examining its\nvarious appointments and details, to see that nothing was amiss. He\ngreatly valued his possessions, chiefly because they were his, and\nderived genuine pleasure from contemplating a painting, a statuette, a\nrare lace curtain--no matter what--after he had bought it and placed it\namong his household gods.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday afternoons--Tuesday being Mrs. Pontellier's reception\nday--there was a constant stream of callers--women who came in carriages\nor in the street cars, or walked when the air was soft and distance\npermitted. A light-colored mulatto boy, in dress coat and bearing a\ndiminutive silver tray for the reception of cards, admitted them. A\nmaid, in white fluted cap, offered the callers liqueur, coffee, or\nchocolate, as they might desire. Mrs. Pontellier, attired in a handsome\nreception gown, remained in the drawing-room the entire afternoon\nreceiving her visitors. Men sometimes called in the evening with their\nwives.</p>\n<p>This had been the programme which Mrs. Pontellier had religiously\nfollowed since her marriage, six years before. Certain evenings during\nthe week she and her husband attended the opera or sometimes the play.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pontellier left his home in the mornings between nine and ten\no'clock, and rarely returned before half-past six or seven in the\nevening--dinner being served at half-past seven.</p>\n<p>He and his wife seated themselves at table one Tuesday evening, a few\nweeks after their return from Grand Isle. They were alone together.\nThe boys were being put to bed; the patter of their bare, escaping\nfeet could be heard occasionally, as well as the pursuing voice of the\nquadroon, lifted in mild protest and entreaty. Mrs. Pontellier did not\nwear her usual Tuesday reception gown; she was in ordinary house dress.\nMr. Pontellier, who was observant about such things, noticed it, as he\nserved the soup and handed it to the boy in waiting.</p>\n<p>“Tired out, Edna? Whom did you have? Many callers?” he asked. He\ntasted his soup and began to season it with pepper, salt, vinegar,\nmustard--everything within reach.</p>\n<p>“There were a good many,” replied Edna, who was eating her soup with\nevident satisfaction. “I found their cards when I got home; I was out.”</p>\n<p>“Out!” exclaimed her husband, with something like genuine consternation\nin his voice as he laid down the vinegar cruet and looked at her through\nhis glasses. “Why, what could have taken you out on Tuesday? What did\nyou have to do?”</p>\n<p>“Nothing. I simply felt like going out, and I went out.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I hope you left some suitable excuse,” said her husband, somewhat\nappeased, as he added a dash of cayenne pepper to the soup.</p>\n<p>“No, I left no excuse. I told Joe to say I was out, that was all.”</p>\n<p>“Why, my dear, I should think you'd understand by this time that people\ndon't do such things; we've got to observe les convenances if we ever\nexpect to get on and keep up with the procession. If you felt that you\nhad to leave home this afternoon, you should have left some suitable\nexplanation for your absence.</p>\n<p>“This soup is really impossible; it's strange that woman hasn't learned\nyet to make a decent soup. Any free-lunch stand in town serves a better\none. Was Mrs. Belthrop here?”</p>\n<p>“Bring the tray with the cards, Joe. I don't remember who was here.”</p>\n<p>The boy retired and returned after a moment, bringing the tiny silver\ntray, which was covered with ladies' visiting cards. He handed it to\nMrs. Pontellier.</p>\n<p>“Give it to Mr. Pontellier,” she said.</p>\n<p>Joe offered the tray to Mr. Pontellier, and removed the soup.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pontellier scanned the names of his wife's callers, reading some of\nthem aloud, with comments as he read.</p>\n<p>“'The Misses Delasidas.' I worked a big deal in futures for their father\nthis morning; nice girls; it's time they were getting married. 'Mrs.\nBelthrop.' I tell you what it is, Edna; you can't afford to snub Mrs.\nBelthrop. Why, Belthrop could buy and sell us ten times over. His\nbusiness is worth a good, round sum to me. You'd better write her a\nnote. 'Mrs. James Highcamp.' Hugh! the less you have to do with Mrs.\nHighcamp, the better. 'Madame Laforce.' Came all the way from Carrolton,\ntoo, poor old soul. 'Miss Wiggs,' 'Mrs. Eleanor Boltons.'” He pushed the\ncards aside.</p>\n<p>“Mercy!” exclaimed Edna, who had been fuming. “Why are you taking the\nthing so seriously and making such a fuss over it?”</p>\n<p>“I'm not making any fuss over it. But it's just such seeming trifles\nthat we've got to take seriously; such things count.”</p>\n<p>The fish was scorched. Mr. Pontellier would not touch it. Edna said she\ndid not mind a little scorched taste. The roast was in some way not to\nhis fancy, and he did not like the manner in which the vegetables were\nserved.</p>\n<p>“It seems to me,” he said, “we spend money enough in this house to\nprocure at least one meal a day which a man could eat and retain his\nself-respect.”</p>\n<p>“You used to think the cook was a treasure,” returned Edna,\nindifferently.</p>\n<p>“Perhaps she was when she first came; but cooks are only human. They\nneed looking after, like any other class of persons that you employ.\nSuppose I didn't look after the clerks in my office, just let them\nrun things their own way; they'd soon make a nice mess of me and my\nbusiness.”</p>\n<p>“Where are you going?” asked Edna, seeing that her husband arose\nfrom table without having eaten a morsel except a taste of the\nhighly-seasoned soup.</p>\n<p>“I'm going to get my dinner at the club. Good night.” He went into the\nhall, took his hat and stick from the stand, and left the house.</p>\n<p>She was somewhat familiar with such scenes. They had often made her very\nunhappy. On a few previous occasions she had been completely deprived of\nany desire to finish her dinner. Sometimes she had gone into the kitchen\nto administer a tardy rebuke to the cook. Once she went to her room and\nstudied the cookbook during an entire evening, finally writing out a\nmenu for the week, which left her harassed with a feeling that, after\nall, she had accomplished no good that was worth the name.</p>\n<p>But that evening Edna finished her dinner alone, with forced\ndeliberation. Her face was flushed and her eyes flamed with some inward\nfire that lighted them. After finishing her dinner she went to her\nroom, having instructed the boy to tell any other callers that she was\nindisposed.</p>\n<p>It was a large, beautiful room, rich and picturesque in the soft, dim\nlight which the maid had turned low. She went and stood at an open\nwindow and looked out upon the deep tangle of the garden below. All the\nmystery and witchery of the night seemed to have gathered there amid the\nperfumes and the dusky and tortuous outlines of flowers and foliage.\nShe was seeking herself and finding herself in just such sweet,\nhalf-darkness which met her moods. But the voices were not soothing\nthat came to her from the darkness and the sky above and the stars. They\njeered and sounded mournful notes without promise, devoid even of hope.\nShe turned back into the room and began to walk to and fro down its\nwhole length without stopping, without resting. She carried in her\nhands a thin handkerchief, which she tore into ribbons, rolled into a\nball, and flung from her. Once she stopped, and taking off her wedding\nring, flung it upon the carpet. When she saw it lying there, she stamped\nher heel upon it, striving to crush it. But her small boot heel did not\nmake an indenture, not a mark upon the little glittering circlet.</p>\n<p>In a sweeping passion she seized a glass vase from the table and flung\nit upon the tiles of the hearth. She wanted to destroy something. The\ncrash and clatter were what she wanted to hear.</p>\n<p>A maid, alarmed at the din of breaking glass, entered the room to\ndiscover what was the matter.</p>\n<p>“A vase fell upon the hearth,” said Edna. “Never mind; leave it till\nmorning.”</p>\n<p>“Oh! you might get some of the glass in your feet, ma'am,” insisted the\nyoung woman, picking up bits of the broken vase that were scattered upon\nthe carpet. “And here's your ring, ma'am, under the chair.”</p>\n<p>Edna held out her hand, and taking the ring, slipped it upon her finger.</p>\n<p>XVIII</p>\n<p>The following morning Mr. Pontellier, upon leaving for his office, asked\nEdna if she would not meet him in town in order to look at some new\nfixtures for the library.</p>\n<p>“I hardly think we need new fixtures, Leonce. Don't let us get anything\nnew; you are too extravagant. I don't believe you ever think of saving\nor putting by.”</p>\n<p>“The way to become rich is to make money, my dear Edna, not to save it,”\nhe said. He regretted that she did not feel inclined to go with him and\nselect new fixtures. He kissed her good-by, and told her she was not\nlooking well and must take care of herself. She was unusually pale and\nvery quiet.</p>\n<p>She stood on the front veranda as he quitted the house, and absently\npicked a few sprays of jessamine that grew upon a trellis near by. She\ninhaled the odor of the blossoms and thrust them into the bosom of her\nwhite morning gown. The boys were dragging along the banquette a small\n“express wagon,” which they had filled with blocks and sticks. The\nquadroon was following them with little quick steps, having assumed a\nfictitious animation and alacrity for the occasion. A fruit vender was\ncrying his wares in the street.</p>\n<p>Edna looked straight before her with a self-absorbed expression upon\nher face. She felt no interest in anything about her. The street, the\nchildren, the fruit vender, the flowers growing there under her eyes,\nwere all part and parcel of an alien world which had suddenly become\nantagonistic.</p>\n<p>She went back into the house. She had thought of speaking to the cook\nconcerning her blunders of the previous night; but Mr. Pontellier had\nsaved her that disagreeable mission, for which she was so poorly fitted.\nMr. Pontellier's arguments were usually convincing with those whom he\nemployed. He left home feeling quite sure that he and Edna would sit\ndown that evening, and possibly a few subsequent evenings, to a dinner\ndeserving of the name.</p>\n<p>Edna spent an hour or two in looking over some of her old sketches.\nShe could see their shortcomings and defects, which were glaring in her\neyes. She tried to work a little, but found she was not in the humor.\nFinally she gathered together a few of the sketches--those which she\nconsidered the least discreditable; and she carried them with her when,\na little later, she dressed and left the house. She looked handsome and\ndistinguished in her street gown. The tan of the seashore had left\nher face, and her forehead was smooth, white, and polished beneath her\nheavy, yellow-brown hair. There were a few freckles on her face, and a\nsmall, dark mole near the under lip and one on the temple, half-hidden\nin her hair.</p>\n<p>As Edna walked along the street she was thinking of Robert. She was\nstill under the spell of her infatuation. She had tried to forget him,\nrealizing the inutility of remembering. But the thought of him was like\nan obsession, ever pressing itself upon her. It was not that she dwelt\nupon details of their acquaintance, or recalled in any special or\npeculiar way his personality; it was his being, his existence, which\ndominated her thought, fading sometimes as if it would melt into the\nmist of the forgotten, reviving again with an intensity which filled her\nwith an incomprehensible longing.</p>\n<p>Edna was on her way to Madame Ratignolle's. Their intimacy, begun at\nGrand Isle, had not declined, and they had seen each other with some\nfrequency since their return to the city. The Ratignolles lived at no\ngreat distance from Edna's home, on the corner of a side street, where\nMonsieur Ratignolle owned and conducted a drug store which enjoyed a\nsteady and prosperous trade. His father had been in the business before\nhim, and Monsieur Ratignolle stood well in the community and bore an\nenviable reputation for integrity and clearheadedness. His family lived\nin commodious apartments over the store, having an entrance on the side\nwithin the porte cochere. There was something which Edna thought very\nFrench, very foreign, about their whole manner of living. In the large\nand pleasant salon which extended across the width of the house, the\nRatignolles entertained their friends once a fortnight with a soiree\nmusicale, sometimes diversified by card-playing. There was a friend who\nplayed upon the 'cello. One brought his flute and another his violin,\nwhile there were some who sang and a number who performed upon the piano\nwith various degrees of taste and agility. The Ratignolles' soirees\nmusicales were widely known, and it was considered a privilege to be\ninvited to them.</p>\n<p>Edna found her friend engaged in assorting the clothes which had\nreturned that morning from the laundry. She at once abandoned her\noccupation upon seeing Edna, who had been ushered without ceremony into\nher presence.</p>\n<p>“'Cite can do it as well as I; it is really her business,” she explained\nto Edna, who apologized for interrupting her. And she summoned a young\nblack woman, whom she instructed, in French, to be very careful in\nchecking off the list which she handed her. She told her to notice\nparticularly if a fine linen handkerchief of Monsieur Ratignolle's,\nwhich was missing last week, had been returned; and to be sure to set to\none side such pieces as required mending and darning.</p>\n<p>Then placing an arm around Edna's waist, she led her to the front of the\nhouse, to the salon, where it was cool and sweet with the odor of great\nroses that stood upon the hearth in jars.</p>\n<p>Madame Ratignolle looked more beautiful than ever there at home, in a\nneglige which left her arms almost wholly bare and exposed the rich,\nmelting curves of her white throat.</p>\n<p>“Perhaps I shall be able to paint your picture some day,” said Edna with\na smile when they were seated. She produced the roll of sketches and\nstarted to unfold them. “I believe I ought to work again. I feel as if I\nwanted to be doing something. What do you think of them? Do you think it\nworth while to take it up again and study some more? I might study for a\nwhile with Laidpore.”</p>\n<p>She knew that Madame Ratignolle's opinion in such a matter would be next\nto valueless, that she herself had not alone decided, but determined;\nbut she sought the words of praise and encouragement that would help her\nto put heart into her venture.</p>\n<p>“Your talent is immense, dear!”</p>\n<p>“Nonsense!” protested Edna, well pleased.</p>\n<p>“Immense, I tell you,” persisted Madame Ratignolle, surveying the\nsketches one by one, at close range, then holding them at arm's length,\nnarrowing her eyes, and dropping her head on one side. “Surely, this\nBavarian peasant is worthy of framing; and this basket of apples! never\nhave I seen anything more lifelike. One might almost be tempted to reach\nout a hand and take one.”</p>\n<p>Edna could not control a feeling which bordered upon complacency at\nher friend's praise, even realizing, as she did, its true worth.\nShe retained a few of the sketches, and gave all the rest to Madame\nRatignolle, who appreciated the gift far beyond its value and proudly\nexhibited the pictures to her husband when he came up from the store a\nlittle later for his midday dinner.</p>\n<p>Mr. Ratignolle was one of those men who are called the salt of the\nearth. His cheerfulness was unbounded, and it was matched by his\ngoodness of heart, his broad charity, and common sense. He and his wife\nspoke English with an accent which was only discernible through its\nun-English emphasis and a certain carefulness and deliberation.\nEdna's husband spoke English with no accent whatever. The Ratignolles\nunderstood each other perfectly. If ever the fusion of two human beings\ninto one has been accomplished on this sphere it was surely in their\nunion.</p>\n<p>As Edna seated herself at table with them she thought, “Better a dinner\nof herbs,” though it did not take her long to discover that it was no\ndinner of herbs, but a delicious repast, simple, choice, and in every\nway satisfying.</p>\n<p>Monsieur Ratignolle was delighted to see her, though he found her\nlooking not so well as at Grand Isle, and he advised a tonic. He talked\na good deal on various topics, a little politics, some city news and\nneighborhood gossip. He spoke with an animation and earnestness that\ngave an exaggerated importance to every syllable he uttered. His wife\nwas keenly interested in everything he said, laying down her fork the\nbetter to listen, chiming in, taking the words out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>Edna felt depressed rather than soothed after leaving them. The little\nglimpse of domestic harmony which had been offered her, gave her no\nregret, no longing. It was not a condition of life which fitted her, and\nshe could see in it but an appalling and hopeless ennui. She was moved\nby a kind of commiseration for Madame Ratignolle,--a pity for that\ncolorless existence which never uplifted its possessor beyond the region\nof blind contentment, in which no moment of anguish ever visited her\nsoul, in which she would never have the taste of life's delirium. Edna\nvaguely wondered what she meant by “life's delirium.” It had crossed her\nthought like some unsought, extraneous impression.</p>\n<p>XIX</p>\n<p>Edna could not help but think that it was very foolish, very childish,\nto have stamped upon her wedding ring and smashed the crystal vase upon\nthe tiles. She was visited by no more outbursts, moving her to such\nfutile expedients. She began to do as she liked and to feel as she\nliked. She completely abandoned her Tuesdays at home, and did not return\nthe visits of those who had called upon her. She made no ineffectual\nefforts to conduct her household en bonne menagere, going and coming as\nit suited her fancy, and, so far as she was able, lending herself to any\npassing caprice.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pontellier had been a rather courteous husband so long as he met\na certain tacit submissiveness in his wife. But her new and unexpected\nline of conduct completely bewildered him. It shocked him. Then her\nabsolute disregard for her duties as a wife angered him. When Mr.\nPontellier became rude, Edna grew insolent. She had resolved never to\ntake another step backward.</p>\n<p>“It seems to me the utmost folly for a woman at the head of a household,\nand the mother of children, to spend in an atelier days which would be\nbetter employed contriving for the comfort of her family.”</p>\n<p>“I feel like painting,” answered Edna. “Perhaps I shan't always feel\nlike it.”</p>\n<p>“Then in God's name paint! but don't let the family go to the devil.\nThere's Madame Ratignolle; because she keeps up her music, she doesn't\nlet everything else go to chaos. And she's more of a musician than you\nare a painter.”</p>\n<p>“She isn't a musician, and I'm not a painter. It isn't on account of\npainting that I let things go.”</p>\n<p>“On account of what, then?”</p>\n<p>“Oh! I don't know. Let me alone; you bother me.”</p>\n<p>It sometimes entered Mr. Pontellier's mind to wonder if his wife were\nnot growing a little unbalanced mentally. He could see plainly that she\nwas not herself. That is, he could not see that she was becoming herself\nand daily casting aside that fictitious self which we assume like a\ngarment with which to appear before the world.</p>\n<p>Her husband let her alone as she requested, and went away to his office.\nEdna went up to her atelier--a bright room in the top of the house.\nShe was working with great energy and interest, without accomplishing\nanything, however, which satisfied her even in the smallest degree. For\na time she had the whole household enrolled in the service of art. The\nboys posed for her. They thought it amusing at first, but the occupation\nsoon lost its attractiveness when they discovered that it was not a game\narranged especially for their entertainment. The quadroon sat for hours\nbefore Edna's palette, patient as a savage, while the house-maid took\ncharge of the children, and the drawing-room went undusted. But the\nhousemaid, too, served her term as model when Edna perceived that the\nyoung woman's back and shoulders were molded on classic lines, and that\nher hair, loosened from its confining cap, became an inspiration. While\nEdna worked she sometimes sang low the little air, “Ah! si tu savais!”</p>\n<p>It moved her with recollections. She could hear again the ripple of the\nwater, the flapping sail. She could see the glint of the moon upon the\nbay, and could feel the soft, gusty beating of the hot south wind. A\nsubtle current of desire passed through her body, weakening her hold\nupon the brushes and making her eyes burn.</p>\n<p>There were days when she was very happy without knowing why. She was\nhappy to be alive and breathing, when her whole being seemed to be one\nwith the sunlight, the color, the odors, the luxuriant warmth of some\nperfect Southern day. She liked then to wander alone into strange and\nunfamiliar places. She discovered many a sunny, sleepy corner, fashioned\nto dream in. And she found it good to dream and to be alone and\nunmolested.</p>\n<p>There were days when she was unhappy, she did not know why,--when it did\nnot seem worth while to be glad or sorry, to be alive or dead; when life\nappeared to her like a grotesque pandemonium and humanity like worms\nstruggling blindly toward inevitable annihilation. She could not work on\nsuch a day, nor weave fancies to stir her pulses and warm her blood.</p>\n<p>XX</p>\n<p>It was during such a mood that Edna hunted up Mademoiselle Reisz. She\nhad not forgotten the rather disagreeable impression left upon her\nby their last interview; but she nevertheless felt a desire to see\nher--above all, to listen while she played upon the piano. Quite\nearly in the afternoon she started upon her quest for the pianist.\nUnfortunately she had mislaid or lost Mademoiselle Reisz's card, and\nlooking up her address in the city directory, she found that the woman\nlived on Bienville Street, some distance away. The directory which fell\ninto her hands was a year or more old, however, and upon reaching the\nnumber indicated, Edna discovered that the house was occupied by a\nrespectable family of mulattoes who had chambres garnies to let. They\nhad been living there for six months, and knew absolutely nothing of\na Mademoiselle Reisz. In fact, they knew nothing of any of their\nneighbors; their lodgers were all people of the highest distinction,\nthey assured Edna. She did not linger to discuss class distinctions with\nMadame Pouponne, but hastened to a neighboring grocery store, feeling\nsure that Mademoiselle would have left her address with the proprietor.</p>\n<p>He knew Mademoiselle Reisz a good deal better than he wanted to know\nher, he informed his questioner. In truth, he did not want to know her\nat all, or anything concerning her--the most disagreeable and unpopular\nwoman who ever lived in Bienville Street. He thanked heaven she had left\nthe neighborhood, and was equally thankful that he did not know where\nshe had gone.</p>\n<p>Edna's desire to see Mademoiselle Reisz had increased tenfold since\nthese unlooked-for obstacles had arisen to thwart it. She was wondering\nwho could give her the information she sought, when it suddenly occurred\nto her that Madame Lebrun would be the one most likely to do so. She\nknew it was useless to ask Madame Ratignolle, who was on the most\ndistant terms with the musician, and preferred to know nothing\nconcerning her. She had once been almost as emphatic in expressing\nherself upon the subject as the corner grocer.</p>\n<p>Edna knew that Madame Lebrun had returned to the city, for it was\nthe middle of November. And she also knew where the Lebruns lived, on\nChartres Street.</p>\n<p>Their home from the outside looked like a prison, with iron bars before\nthe door and lower windows. The iron bars were a relic of the old\nregime, and no one had ever thought of dislodging them. At the side\nwas a high fence enclosing the garden. A gate or door opening upon the\nstreet was locked. Edna rang the bell at this side garden gate, and\nstood upon the banquette, waiting to be admitted.</p>\n<p>It was Victor who opened the gate for her. A black woman, wiping her\nhands upon her apron, was close at his heels. Before she saw them Edna\ncould hear them in altercation, the woman--plainly an anomaly--claiming\nthe right to be allowed to perform her duties, one of which was to\nanswer the bell.</p>\n<p>Victor was surprised and delighted to see Mrs. Pontellier, and he made\nno attempt to conceal either his astonishment or his delight. He was a\ndark-browed, good-looking youngster of nineteen, greatly resembling\nhis mother, but with ten times her impetuosity. He instructed the\nblack woman to go at once and inform Madame Lebrun that Mrs. Pontellier\ndesired to see her. The woman grumbled a refusal to do part of her duty\nwhen she had not been permitted to do it all, and started back to her\ninterrupted task of weeding the garden. Whereupon Victor administered\na rebuke in the form of a volley of abuse, which, owing to its rapidity\nand incoherence, was all but incomprehensible to Edna. Whatever it\nwas, the rebuke was convincing, for the woman dropped her hoe and went\nmumbling into the house.</p>\n<p>Edna did not wish to enter. It was very pleasant there on the side\nporch, where there were chairs, a wicker lounge, and a small table. She\nseated herself, for she was tired from her long tramp; and she began to\nrock gently and smooth out the folds of her silk parasol. Victor drew\nup his chair beside her. He at once explained that the black woman's\noffensive conduct was all due to imperfect training, as he was not there\nto take her in hand. He had only come up from the island the morning\nbefore, and expected to return next day. He stayed all winter at the\nisland; he lived there, and kept the place in order and got things ready\nfor the summer visitors.</p>\n<p>But a man needed occasional relaxation, he informed Mrs. Pontellier, and\nevery now and again he drummed up a pretext to bring him to the city.\nMy! but he had had a time of it the evening before! He wouldn't want his\nmother to know, and he began to talk in a whisper. He was scintillant\nwith recollections. Of course, he couldn't think of telling Mrs.\nPontellier all about it, she being a woman and not comprehending such\nthings. But it all began with a girl peeping and smiling at him through\nthe shutters as he passed by. Oh! but she was a beauty! Certainly he\nsmiled back, and went up and talked to her. Mrs. Pontellier did not know\nhim if she supposed he was one to let an opportunity like that escape\nhim. Despite herself, the youngster amused her. She must have betrayed\nin her look some degree of interest or entertainment. The boy grew more\ndaring, and Mrs. Pontellier might have found herself, in a little while,\nlistening to a highly colored story but for the timely appearance of\nMadame Lebrun.</p>\n<p>That lady was still clad in white, according to her custom of the\nsummer. Her eyes beamed an effusive welcome. Would not Mrs. Pontellier\ngo inside? Would she partake of some refreshment? Why had she not been\nthere before? How was that dear Mr. Pontellier and how were those sweet\nchildren? Had Mrs. Pontellier ever known such a warm November?</p>\n<p>Victor went and reclined on the wicker lounge behind his mother's chair,\nwhere he commanded a view of Edna's face. He had taken her parasol from\nher hands while he spoke to her, and he now lifted it and twirled it\nabove him as he lay on his back. When Madame Lebrun complained that it\nwas so dull coming back to the city; that she saw so few people now;\nthat even Victor, when he came up from the island for a day or two, had\nso much to occupy him and engage his time; then it was that the youth\nwent into contortions on the lounge and winked mischievously at Edna.\nShe somehow felt like a confederate in crime, and tried to look severe\nand disapproving.</p>\n<p>There had been but two letters from Robert, with little in them, they\ntold her. Victor said it was really not worth while to go inside for\nthe letters, when his mother entreated him to go in search of them. He\nremembered the contents, which in truth he rattled off very glibly when\nput to the test.</p>\n<p>One letter was written from Vera Cruz and the other from the City\nof Mexico. He had met Montel, who was doing everything toward his\nadvancement. So far, the financial situation was no improvement over the\none he had left in New Orleans, but of course the prospects were vastly\nbetter. He wrote of the City of Mexico, the buildings, the people and\ntheir habits, the conditions of life which he found there. He sent his\nlove to the family. He inclosed a check to his mother, and hoped she\nwould affectionately remember him to all his friends. That was about the\nsubstance of the two letters. Edna felt that if there had been a message\nfor her, she would have received it. The despondent frame of mind in\nwhich she had left home began again to overtake her, and she remembered\nthat she wished to find Mademoiselle Reisz.</p>\n<p>Madame Lebrun knew where Mademoiselle Reisz lived. She gave Edna the\naddress, regretting that she would not consent to stay and spend the\nremainder of the afternoon, and pay a visit to Mademoiselle Reisz some\nother day. The afternoon was already well advanced.</p>\n<p>Victor escorted her out upon the banquette, lifted her parasol, and held\nit over her while he walked to the car with her. He entreated her\nto bear in mind that the disclosures of the afternoon were strictly\nconfidential. She laughed and bantered him a little, remembering too\nlate that she should have been dignified and reserved.</p>\n<p>“How handsome Mrs. Pontellier looked!” said Madame Lebrun to her son.</p>\n<p>“Ravishing!” he admitted. “The city atmosphere has improved her. Some\nway she doesn't seem like the same woman.”</p>\n<p>XXI</p>\n<p>Some people contended that the reason Mademoiselle Reisz always chose\napartments up under the roof was to discourage the approach of beggars,\npeddlars and callers. There were plenty of windows in her little front\nroom. They were for the most part dingy, but as they were nearly always\nopen it did not make so much difference. They often admitted into the\nroom a good deal of smoke and soot; but at the same time all the light\nand air that there was came through them. From her windows could be seen\nthe crescent of the river, the masts of ships and the big chimneys of\nthe Mississippi steamers. A magnificent piano crowded the apartment.\nIn the next room she slept, and in the third and last she harbored a\ngasoline stove on which she cooked her meals when disinclined to descend\nto the neighboring restaurant. It was there also that she ate, keeping\nher belongings in a rare old buffet, dingy and battered from a hundred\nyears of use.</p>\n<p>When Edna knocked at Mademoiselle Reisz's front room door and entered,\nshe discovered that person standing beside the window, engaged in\nmending or patching an old prunella gaiter. The little musician laughed\nall over when she saw Edna. Her laugh consisted of a contortion of the\nface and all the muscles of the body. She seemed strikingly homely,\nstanding there in the afternoon light. She still wore the shabby lace\nand the artificial bunch of violets on the side of her head.</p>\n<p>“So you remembered me at last,” said Mademoiselle. “I had said to\nmyself, 'Ah, bah! she will never come.'”</p>\n<p>“Did you want me to come?” asked Edna with a smile.</p>\n<p>“I had not thought much about it,” answered Mademoiselle. The two had\nseated themselves on a little bumpy sofa which stood against the wall.\n“I am glad, however, that you came. I have the water boiling back there,\nand was just about to make some coffee. You will drink a cup with\nme. And how is la belle dame? Always handsome! always healthy! always\ncontented!” She took Edna's hand between her strong wiry fingers,\nholding it loosely without warmth, and executing a sort of double theme\nupon the back and palm.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” she went on; “I sometimes thought: 'She will never come. She\npromised as those women in society always do, without meaning it.\nShe will not come.' For I really don't believe you like me, Mrs.\nPontellier.”</p>\n<p>“I don't know whether I like you or not,” replied Edna, gazing down at\nthe little woman with a quizzical look.</p>\n<p>The candor of Mrs. Pontellier's admission greatly pleased Mademoiselle\nReisz. She expressed her gratification by repairing forthwith to the\nregion of the gasoline stove and rewarding her guest with the promised\ncup of coffee. The coffee and the biscuit accompanying it proved very\nacceptable to Edna, who had declined refreshment at Madame Lebrun's and\nwas now beginning to feel hungry. Mademoiselle set the tray which she\nbrought in upon a small table near at hand, and seated herself once\nagain on the lumpy sofa.</p>\n<p>“I have had a letter from your friend,” she remarked, as she poured a\nlittle cream into Edna's cup and handed it to her.</p>\n<p>“My friend?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, your friend Robert. He wrote to me from the City of Mexico.”</p>\n<p>“Wrote to YOU?” repeated Edna in amazement, stirring her coffee\nabsently.</p>\n<p>“Yes, to me. Why not? Don't stir all the warmth out of your coffee;\ndrink it. Though the letter might as well have been sent to you; it was\nnothing but Mrs. Pontellier from beginning to end.”</p>\n<p>“Let me see it,” requested the young woman, entreatingly.</p>\n<p>“No; a letter concerns no one but the person who writes it and the one\nto whom it is written.”</p>\n<p>“Haven't you just said it concerned me from beginning to end?”</p>\n<p>“It was written about you, not to you. 'Have you seen Mrs. Pontellier?\nHow is she looking?' he asks. 'As Mrs. Pontellier says,' or 'as Mrs.\nPontellier once said.' 'If Mrs. Pontellier should call upon you, play\nfor her that Impromptu of Chopin's, my favorite. I heard it here a day\nor two ago, but not as you play it. I should like to know how it affects\nher,' and so on, as if he supposed we were constantly in each other's\nsociety.”</p>\n<p>“Let me see the letter.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, no.”</p>\n<p>“Have you answered it?”</p>\n<p>“No.”</p>\n<p>“Let me see the letter.”</p>\n<p>“No, and again, no.”</p>\n<p>“Then play the Impromptu for me.”</p>\n<p>“It is growing late; what time do you have to be home?”</p>\n<p>“Time doesn't concern me. Your question seems a little rude. Play the\nImpromptu.”</p>\n<p>“But you have told me nothing of yourself. What are you doing?”</p>\n<p>“Painting!” laughed Edna. “I am becoming an artist. Think of it!”</p>\n<p>“Ah! an artist! You have pretensions, Madame.”</p>\n<p>“Why pretensions? Do you think I could not become an artist?”</p>\n<p>“I do not know you well enough to say. I do not know your talent or\nyour temperament. To be an artist includes much; one must possess many\ngifts--absolute gifts--which have not been acquired by one's own effort.\nAnd, moreover, to succeed, the artist must possess the courageous soul.”</p>\n<p>“What do you mean by the courageous soul?”</p>\n<p>“Courageous, ma foi! The brave soul. The soul that dares and defies.”</p>\n<p>“Show me the letter and play for me the Impromptu. You see that I have\npersistence. Does that quality count for anything in art?”</p>\n<p>“It counts with a foolish old woman whom you have captivated,” replied\nMademoiselle, with her wriggling laugh.</p>\n<p>The letter was right there at hand in the drawer of the little table\nupon which Edna had just placed her coffee cup. Mademoiselle opened\nthe drawer and drew forth the letter, the topmost one. She placed it in\nEdna's hands, and without further comment arose and went to the piano.</p>\n<p>Mademoiselle played a soft interlude. It was an improvisation. She sat\nlow at the instrument, and the lines of her body settled into ungraceful\ncurves and angles that gave it an appearance of deformity. Gradually and\nimperceptibly the interlude melted into the soft opening minor chords of\nthe Chopin Impromptu.</p>\n<p>Edna did not know when the Impromptu began or ended. She sat in the sofa\ncorner reading Robert's letter by the fading light. Mademoiselle had\nglided from the Chopin into the quivering love notes of Isolde's song,\nand back again to the Impromptu with its soulful and poignant longing.</p>\n<p>The shadows deepened in the little room. The music grew strange and\nfantastic--turbulent, insistent, plaintive and soft with entreaty. The\nshadows grew deeper. The music filled the room. It floated out upon the\nnight, over the housetops, the crescent of the river, losing itself in\nthe silence of the upper air.</p>\n<p>Edna was sobbing, just as she had wept one midnight at Grand Isle when\nstrange, new voices awoke in her. She arose in some agitation to take\nher departure. “May I come again, Mademoiselle?” she asked at the\nthreshold.</p>\n<p>“Come whenever you feel like it. Be careful; the stairs and landings are\ndark; don't stumble.”</p>\n<p>Mademoiselle reentered and lit a candle. Robert's letter was on the\nfloor. She stooped and picked it up. It was crumpled and damp with\ntears. Mademoiselle smoothed the letter out, restored it to the\nenvelope, and replaced it in the table drawer.</p>\n<p>XXII</p>\n<p>One morning on his way into town Mr. Pontellier stopped at the house of\nhis old friend and family physician, Doctor Mandelet. The Doctor was a\nsemi-retired physician, resting, as the saying is, upon his laurels.\nHe bore a reputation for wisdom rather than skill--leaving the active\npractice of medicine to his assistants and younger contemporaries--and\nwas much sought for in matters of consultation. A few families, united\nto him by bonds of friendship, he still attended when they required the\nservices of a physician. The Pontelliers were among these.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pontellier found the Doctor reading at the open window of his study.\nHis house stood rather far back from the street, in the center of\na delightful garden, so that it was quiet and peaceful at the\nold gentleman's study window. He was a great reader. He stared up\ndisapprovingly over his eye-glasses as Mr. Pontellier entered, wondering\nwho had the temerity to disturb him at that hour of the morning.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Pontellier! Not sick, I hope. Come and have a seat. What news do\nyou bring this morning?” He was quite portly, with a profusion of\ngray hair, and small blue eyes which age had robbed of much of their\nbrightness but none of their penetration.</p>\n<p>“Oh! I'm never sick, Doctor. You know that I come of tough fiber--of\nthat old Creole race of Pontelliers that dry up and finally blow away.\nI came to consult--no, not precisely to consult--to talk to you about\nEdna. I don't know what ails her.”</p>\n<p>“Madame Pontellier not well,” marveled the Doctor. “Why, I saw her--I\nthink it was a week ago--walking along Canal Street, the picture of\nhealth, it seemed to me.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes; she seems quite well,” said Mr. Pontellier, leaning forward\nand whirling his stick between his two hands; “but she doesn't act well.\nShe's odd, she's not like herself. I can't make her out, and I thought\nperhaps you'd help me.”</p>\n<p>“How does she act?” inquired the Doctor.</p>\n<p>“Well, it isn't easy to explain,” said Mr. Pontellier, throwing himself\nback in his chair. “She lets the housekeeping go to the dickens.”</p>\n<p>“Well, well; women are not all alike, my dear Pontellier. We've got to\nconsider--”</p>\n<p>“I know that; I told you I couldn't explain. Her whole attitude--toward\nme and everybody and everything--has changed. You know I have a quick\ntemper, but I don't want to quarrel or be rude to a woman, especially my\nwife; yet I'm driven to it, and feel like ten thousand devils after I've\nmade a fool of myself. She's making it devilishly uncomfortable for\nme,” he went on nervously. “She's got some sort of notion in her head\nconcerning the eternal rights of women; and--you understand--we meet in\nthe morning at the breakfast table.”</p>\n<p>The old gentleman lifted his shaggy eyebrows, protruded his thick nether\nlip, and tapped the arms of his chair with his cushioned fingertips.</p>\n<p>“What have you been doing to her, Pontellier?”</p>\n<p>“Doing! Parbleu!”</p>\n<p>“Has she,” asked the Doctor, with a smile, “has she been associating\nof late with a circle of pseudo-intellectual women--super-spiritual\nsuperior beings? My wife has been telling me about them.”</p>\n<p>“That's the trouble,” broke in Mr. Pontellier, “she hasn't been\nassociating with any one. She has abandoned her Tuesdays at home, has\nthrown over all her acquaintances, and goes tramping about by herself,\nmoping in the street-cars, getting in after dark. I tell you she's\npeculiar. I don't like it; I feel a little worried over it.”</p>\n<p>This was a new aspect for the Doctor. “Nothing hereditary?” he asked,\nseriously. “Nothing peculiar about her family antecedents, is there?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, no, indeed! She comes of sound old Presbyterian Kentucky stock. The\nold gentleman, her father, I have heard, used to atone for his weekday\nsins with his Sunday devotions. I know for a fact, that his race horses\nliterally ran away with the prettiest bit of Kentucky farming land\nI ever laid eyes upon. Margaret--you know Margaret--she has all the\nPresbyterianism undiluted. And the youngest is something of a vixen. By\nthe way, she gets married in a couple of weeks from now.”</p>\n<p>“Send your wife up to the wedding,” exclaimed the Doctor, foreseeing a\nhappy solution. “Let her stay among her own people for a while; it will\ndo her good.”</p>\n<p>“That's what I want her to do. She won't go to the marriage. She says\na wedding is one of the most lamentable spectacles on earth. Nice thing\nfor a woman to say to her husband!” exclaimed Mr. Pontellier, fuming\nanew at the recollection.</p>\n<p>“Pontellier,” said the Doctor, after a moment's reflection, “let your\nwife alone for a while. Don't bother her, and don't let her bother\nyou. Woman, my dear friend, is a very peculiar and delicate organism--a\nsensitive and highly organized woman, such as I know Mrs. Pontellier to\nbe, is especially peculiar. It would require an inspired psychologist to\ndeal successfully with them. And when ordinary fellows like you and me\nattempt to cope with their idiosyncrasies the result is bungling. Most\nwomen are moody and whimsical. This is some passing whim of your wife,\ndue to some cause or causes which you and I needn't try to fathom. But\nit will pass happily over, especially if you let her alone. Send her\naround to see me.”</p>\n<p>“Oh! I couldn't do that; there'd be no reason for it,” objected Mr.\nPontellier.</p>\n<p>“Then I'll go around and see her,” said the Doctor. “I'll drop in to\ndinner some evening en bon ami.</p>\n<p>“Do! by all means,” urged Mr. Pontellier. “What evening will you come?\nSay Thursday. Will you come Thursday?” he asked, rising to take his\nleave.</p>\n<p>“Very well; Thursday. My wife may possibly have some engagement for\nme Thursday. In case she has, I shall let you know. Otherwise, you may\nexpect me.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Pontellier turned before leaving to say:</p>\n<p>“I am going to New York on business very soon. I have a big scheme on\nhand, and want to be on the field proper to pull the ropes and handle\nthe ribbons. We'll let you in on the inside if you say so, Doctor,” he\nlaughed.</p>\n<p>“No, I thank you, my dear sir,” returned the Doctor. “I leave such\nventures to you younger men with the fever of life still in your blood.”</p>\n<p>“What I wanted to say,” continued Mr. Pontellier, with his hand on the\nknob; “I may have to be absent a good while. Would you advise me to take\nEdna along?”</p>\n<p>“By all means, if she wishes to go. If not, leave her here. Don't\ncontradict her. The mood will pass, I assure you. It may take a month,\ntwo, three months--possibly longer, but it will pass; have patience.”</p>\n<p>“Well, good-by, a jeudi,” said Mr. Pontellier, as he let himself out.</p>\n<p>The Doctor would have liked during the course of conversation to ask,\n“Is there any man in the case?” but he knew his Creole too well to make\nsuch a blunder as that.</p>\n<p>He did not resume his book immediately, but sat for a while meditatively\nlooking out into the garden.</p>\n<p>XXIII</p>\n<p>Edna's father was in the city, and had been with them several days.\nShe was not very warmly or deeply attached to him, but they had certain\ntastes in common, and when together they were companionable. His coming\nwas in the nature of a welcome disturbance; it seemed to furnish a new\ndirection for her emotions.</p>\n<p>He had come to purchase a wedding gift for his daughter, Janet, and an\noutfit for himself in which he might make a creditable appearance at\nher marriage. Mr. Pontellier had selected the bridal gift, as every\none immediately connected with him always deferred to his taste in such\nmatters. And his suggestions on the question of dress--which too\noften assumes the nature of a problem--were of inestimable value to his\nfather-in-law. But for the past few days the old gentleman had been upon\nEdna's hands, and in his society she was becoming acquainted with a new\nset of sensations. He had been a colonel in the Confederate army, and\nstill maintained, with the title, the military bearing which had always\naccompanied it. His hair and mustache were white and silky, emphasizing\nthe rugged bronze of his face. He was tall and thin, and wore his coats\npadded, which gave a fictitious breadth and depth to his shoulders\nand chest. Edna and her father looked very distinguished together, and\nexcited a good deal of notice during their perambulations. Upon his\narrival she began by introducing him to her atelier and making a sketch\nof him. He took the whole matter very seriously. If her talent had been\nten-fold greater than it was, it would not have surprised him, convinced\nas he was that he had bequeathed to all of his daughters the germs of a\nmasterful capability, which only depended upon their own efforts to be\ndirected toward successful achievement.</p>\n<p>Before her pencil he sat rigid and unflinching, as he had faced the\ncannon's mouth in days gone by. He resented the intrusion of the\nchildren, who gaped with wondering eyes at him, sitting so stiff up\nthere in their mother's bright atelier. When they drew near he motioned\nthem away with an expressive action of the foot, loath to disturb the\nfixed lines of his countenance, his arms, or his rigid shoulders.</p>\n<p>Edna, anxious to entertain him, invited Mademoiselle Reisz to meet\nhim, having promised him a treat in her piano playing; but Mademoiselle\ndeclined the invitation. So together they attended a soiree musicale\nat the Ratignolles'. Monsieur and Madame Ratignolle made much of the\nColonel, installing him as the guest of honor and engaging him at\nonce to dine with them the following Sunday, or any day which he might\nselect. Madame coquetted with him in the most captivating and naive\nmanner, with eyes, gestures, and a profusion of compliments, till the\nColonel's old head felt thirty years younger on his padded shoulders.\nEdna marveled, not comprehending. She herself was almost devoid of\ncoquetry.</p>\n<p>There were one or two men whom she observed at the soiree musicale;\nbut she would never have felt moved to any kittenish display to attract\ntheir notice--to any feline or feminine wiles to express herself toward\nthem. Their personality attracted her in an agreeable way. Her fancy\nselected them, and she was glad when a lull in the music gave them\nan opportunity to meet her and talk with her. Often on the street the\nglance of strange eyes had lingered in her memory, and sometimes had\ndisturbed her.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pontellier did not attend these soirees musicales. He considered\nthem bourgeois, and found more diversion at the club. To Madame\nRatignolle he said the music dispensed at her soirees was too “heavy,”\ntoo far beyond his untrained comprehension. His excuse flattered her.\nBut she disapproved of Mr. Pontellier's club, and she was frank enough\nto tell Edna so.</p>\n<p>“It's a pity Mr. Pontellier doesn't stay home more in the evenings.\nI think you would be more--well, if you don't mind my saying it--more\nunited, if he did.”</p>\n<p>“Oh! dear no!” said Edna, with a blank look in her eyes. “What should I\ndo if he stayed home? We wouldn't have anything to say to each other.”</p>\n<p>She had not much of anything to say to her father, for that matter; but\nhe did not antagonize her. She discovered that he interested her, though\nshe realized that he might not interest her long; and for the first time\nin her life she felt as if she were thoroughly acquainted with him. He\nkept her busy serving him and ministering to his wants. It amused her\nto do so. She would not permit a servant or one of the children to do\nanything for him which she might do herself. Her husband noticed, and\nthought it was the expression of a deep filial attachment which he had\nnever suspected.</p>\n<p>The Colonel drank numerous “toddies” during the course of the day, which\nleft him, however, imperturbed. He was an expert at concocting strong\ndrinks. He had even invented some, to which he had given fantastic\nnames, and for whose manufacture he required diverse ingredients that it\ndevolved upon Edna to procure for him.</p>\n<p>When Doctor Mandelet dined with the Pontelliers on Thursday he could\ndiscern in Mrs. Pontellier no trace of that morbid condition which her\nhusband had reported to him. She was excited and in a manner radiant.\nShe and her father had been to the race course, and their thoughts when\nthey seated themselves at table were still occupied with the events of\nthe afternoon, and their talk was still of the track. The Doctor had not\nkept pace with turf affairs. He had certain recollections of racing\nin what he called “the good old times” when the Lecompte stables\nflourished, and he drew upon this fund of memories so that he might not\nbe left out and seem wholly devoid of the modern spirit. But he failed\nto impose upon the Colonel, and was even far from impressing him with\nthis trumped-up knowledge of bygone days. Edna had staked her father\non his last venture, with the most gratifying results to both of them.\nBesides, they had met some very charming people, according to the\nColonel's impressions. Mrs. Mortimer Merriman and Mrs. James Highcamp,\nwho were there with Alcee Arobin, had joined them and had enlivened the\nhours in a fashion that warmed him to think of.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pontellier himself had no particular leaning toward horseracing, and\nwas even rather inclined to discourage it as a pastime, especially\nwhen he considered the fate of that blue-grass farm in Kentucky. He\nendeavored, in a general way, to express a particular disapproval, and\nonly succeeded in arousing the ire and opposition of his father-in-law.\nA pretty dispute followed, in which Edna warmly espoused her father's\ncause and the Doctor remained neutral.</p>\n<p>He observed his hostess attentively from under his shaggy brows, and\nnoted a subtle change which had transformed her from the listless woman\nhe had known into a being who, for the moment, seemed palpitant with\nthe forces of life. Her speech was warm and energetic. There was no\nrepression in her glance or gesture. She reminded him of some beautiful,\nsleek animal waking up in the sun.</p>\n<p>The dinner was excellent. The claret was warm and the champagne was\ncold, and under their beneficent influence the threatened unpleasantness\nmelted and vanished with the fumes of the wine.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pontellier warmed up and grew reminiscent. He told some amusing\nplantation experiences, recollections of old Iberville and his youth,\nwhen he hunted 'possum in company with some friendly darky; thrashed\nthe pecan trees, shot the grosbec, and roamed the woods and fields in\nmischievous idleness.</p>\n<p>The Colonel, with little sense of humor and of the fitness of things,\nrelated a somber episode of those dark and bitter days, in which he had\nacted a conspicuous part and always formed a central figure. Nor was\nthe Doctor happier in his selection, when he told the old, ever new\nand curious story of the waning of a woman's love, seeking strange, new\nchannels, only to return to its legitimate source after days of fierce\nunrest. It was one of the many little human documents which had been\nunfolded to him during his long career as a physician. The story did not\nseem especially to impress Edna. She had one of her own to tell, of a\nwoman who paddled away with her lover one night in a pirogue and never\ncame back. They were lost amid the Baratarian Islands, and no one ever\nheard of them or found trace of them from that day to this. It was a\npure invention. She said that Madame Antoine had related it to her.\nThat, also, was an invention. Perhaps it was a dream she had had. But\nevery glowing word seemed real to those who listened. They could feel\nthe hot breath of the Southern night; they could hear the long sweep of\nthe pirogue through the glistening moonlit water, the beating of birds'\nwings, rising startled from among the reeds in the salt-water pools;\nthey could see the faces of the lovers, pale, close together, rapt in\noblivious forgetfulness, drifting into the unknown.</p>\n<p>The champagne was cold, and its subtle fumes played fantastic tricks\nwith Edna's memory that night.</p>\n<p>Outside, away from the glow of the fire and the soft lamplight, the\nnight was chill and murky. The Doctor doubled his old-fashioned cloak\nacross his breast as he strode home through the darkness. He knew his\nfellow-creatures better than most men; knew that inner life which so\nseldom unfolds itself to unanointed eyes. He was sorry he had accepted\nPontellier's invitation. He was growing old, and beginning to need rest\nand an imperturbed spirit. He did not want the secrets of other lives\nthrust upon him.</p>\n<p>“I hope it isn't Arobin,” he muttered to himself as he walked. “I hope\nto heaven it isn't Alcee Arobin.”</p>\n<p>XXIV</p>\n<p>Edna and her father had a warm, and almost violent dispute upon the\nsubject of her refusal to attend her sister's wedding. Mr. Pontellier\ndeclined to interfere, to interpose either his influence or his\nauthority. He was following Doctor Mandelet's advice, and letting her do\nas she liked. The Colonel reproached his daughter for her lack of\nfilial kindness and respect, her want of sisterly affection and womanly\nconsideration. His arguments were labored and unconvincing. He doubted\nif Janet would accept any excuse--forgetting that Edna had offered\nnone. He doubted if Janet would ever speak to her again, and he was sure\nMargaret would not.</p>\n<p>Edna was glad to be rid of her father when he finally took himself\noff with his wedding garments and his bridal gifts, with his padded\nshoulders, his Bible reading, his “toddies” and ponderous oaths.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pontellier followed him closely. He meant to stop at the wedding\non his way to New York and endeavor by every means which money and love\ncould devise to atone somewhat for Edna's incomprehensible action.</p>\n<p>“You are too lenient, too lenient by far, Leonce,” asserted the Colonel.\n“Authority, coercion are what is needed. Put your foot down good and\nhard; the only way to manage a wife. Take my word for it.”</p>\n<p>The Colonel was perhaps unaware that he had coerced his own wife into\nher grave. Mr. Pontellier had a vague suspicion of it which he thought\nit needless to mention at that late day.</p>\n<p>Edna was not so consciously gratified at her husband's leaving home as\nshe had been over the departure of her father. As the day approached\nwhen he was to leave her for a comparatively long stay, she grew melting\nand affectionate, remembering his many acts of consideration and his\nrepeated expressions of an ardent attachment. She was solicitous about\nhis health and his welfare. She bustled around, looking after his\nclothing, thinking about heavy underwear, quite as Madame Ratignolle\nwould have done under similar circumstances. She cried when he went\naway, calling him her dear, good friend, and she was quite certain she\nwould grow lonely before very long and go to join him in New York.</p>\n<p>But after all, a radiant peace settled upon her when she at last found\nherself alone. Even the children were gone. Old Madame Pontellier had\ncome herself and carried them off to Iberville with their quadroon. The\nold madame did not venture to say she was afraid they would be neglected\nduring Leonce's absence; she hardly ventured to think so. She was hungry\nfor them--even a little fierce in her attachment. She did not want them\nto be wholly “children of the pavement,” she always said when begging\nto have them for a space. She wished them to know the country, with its\nstreams, its fields, its woods, its freedom, so delicious to the young.\nShe wished them to taste something of the life their father had lived\nand known and loved when he, too, was a little child.</p>\n<p>When Edna was at last alone, she breathed a big, genuine sigh of relief.\nA feeling that was unfamiliar but very delicious came over her. She\nwalked all through the house, from one room to another, as if inspecting\nit for the first time. She tried the various chairs and lounges, as if\nshe had never sat and reclined upon them before. And she perambulated\naround the outside of the house, investigating, looking to see if\nwindows and shutters were secure and in order. The flowers were like\nnew acquaintances; she approached them in a familiar spirit, and made\nherself at home among them. The garden walks were damp, and Edna called\nto the maid to bring out her rubber sandals. And there she stayed, and\nstooped, digging around the plants, trimming, picking dead, dry leaves.\nThe children's little dog came out, interfering, getting in her way. She\nscolded him, laughed at him, played with him. The garden smelled so good\nand looked so pretty in the afternoon sunlight. Edna plucked all the\nbright flowers she could find, and went into the house with them, she\nand the little dog.</p>\n<p>Even the kitchen assumed a sudden interesting character which she had\nnever before perceived. She went in to give directions to the cook, to\nsay that the butcher would have to bring much less meat, that they would\nrequire only half their usual quantity of bread, of milk and groceries.\nShe told the cook that she herself would be greatly occupied during\nMr. Pontellier's absence, and she begged her to take all thought and\nresponsibility of the larder upon her own shoulders.</p>\n<p>That night Edna dined alone. The candelabra, with a few candles in the\ncenter of the table, gave all the light she needed. Outside the circle\nof light in which she sat, the large dining-room looked solemn and\nshadowy. The cook, placed upon her mettle, served a delicious repast--a\nluscious tenderloin broiled a point. The wine tasted good; the marron\nglace seemed to be just what she wanted. It was so pleasant, too, to\ndine in a comfortable peignoir.</p>\n<p>She thought a little sentimentally about Leonce and the children, and\nwondered what they were doing. As she gave a dainty scrap or two to the\ndoggie, she talked intimately to him about Etienne and Raoul. He was\nbeside himself with astonishment and delight over these companionable\nadvances, and showed his appreciation by his little quick, snappy barks\nand a lively agitation.</p>\n<p>Then Edna sat in the library after dinner and read Emerson until she\ngrew sleepy. She realized that she had neglected her reading, and\ndetermined to start anew upon a course of improving studies, now that\nher time was completely her own to do with as she liked.</p>\n<p>After a refreshing bath, Edna went to bed. And as she snuggled\ncomfortably beneath the eiderdown a sense of restfulness invaded her,\nsuch as she had not known before.</p>\n<p>XXV</p>\n<p>When the weather was dark and cloudy Edna could not work. She needed the\nsun to mellow and temper her mood to the sticking point. She had reached\na stage when she seemed to be no longer feeling her way, working, when\nin the humor, with sureness and ease. And being devoid of ambition, and\nstriving not toward accomplishment, she drew satisfaction from the work\nin itself.</p>\n<p>On rainy or melancholy days Edna went out and sought the society of\nthe friends she had made at Grand Isle. Or else she stayed indoors\nand nursed a mood with which she was becoming too familiar for her own\ncomfort and peace of mind. It was not despair; but it seemed to her as\nif life were passing by, leaving its promise broken and unfulfilled.\nYet there were other days when she listened, was led on and deceived by\nfresh promises which her youth held out to her.</p>\n<p>She went again to the races, and again. Alcee Arobin and Mrs. Highcamp\ncalled for her one bright afternoon in Arobin's drag. Mrs. Highcamp was\na worldly but unaffected, intelligent, slim, tall blonde woman in the\nforties, with an indifferent manner and blue eyes that stared. She had\na daughter who served her as a pretext for cultivating the society of\nyoung men of fashion. Alcee Arobin was one of them. He was a familiar\nfigure at the race course, the opera, the fashionable clubs. There was\na perpetual smile in his eyes, which seldom failed to awaken a\ncorresponding cheerfulness in any one who looked into them and listened\nto his good-humored voice. His manner was quiet, and at times a little\ninsolent. He possessed a good figure, a pleasing face, not overburdened\nwith depth of thought or feeling; and his dress was that of the\nconventional man of fashion.</p>\n<p>He admired Edna extravagantly, after meeting her at the races with her\nfather. He had met her before on other occasions, but she had seemed to\nhim unapproachable until that day. It was at his instigation that Mrs.\nHighcamp called to ask her to go with them to the Jockey Club to witness\nthe turf event of the season.</p>\n<p>There were possibly a few track men out there who knew the race horse as\nwell as Edna, but there was certainly none who knew it better. She sat\nbetween her two companions as one having authority to speak. She laughed\nat Arobin's pretensions, and deplored Mrs. Highcamp's ignorance. The\nrace horse was a friend and intimate associate of her childhood. The\natmosphere of the stables and the breath of the blue grass paddock\nrevived in her memory and lingered in her nostrils. She did not perceive\nthat she was talking like her father as the sleek geldings ambled in\nreview before them. She played for very high stakes, and fortune favored\nher. The fever of the game flamed in her cheeks and eyes, and it got\ninto her blood and into her brain like an intoxicant. People turned\ntheir heads to look at her, and more than one lent an attentive ear to\nher utterances, hoping thereby to secure the elusive but ever-desired\n“tip.” Arobin caught the contagion of excitement which drew him to\nEdna like a magnet. Mrs. Highcamp remained, as usual, unmoved, with her\nindifferent stare and uplifted eyebrows.</p>\n<p>Edna stayed and dined with Mrs. Highcamp upon being urged to do so.\nArobin also remained and sent away his drag.</p>\n<p>The dinner was quiet and uninteresting, save for the cheerful efforts\nof Arobin to enliven things. Mrs. Highcamp deplored the absence of her\ndaughter from the races, and tried to convey to her what she had missed\nby going to the “Dante reading” instead of joining them. The girl held\na geranium leaf up to her nose and said nothing, but looked knowing and\nnoncommittal. Mr. Highcamp was a plain, bald-headed man, who only\ntalked under compulsion. He was unresponsive. Mrs. Highcamp was full of\ndelicate courtesy and consideration toward her husband. She addressed\nmost of her conversation to him at table. They sat in the library after\ndinner and read the evening papers together under the droplight; while\nthe younger people went into the drawing-room near by and talked. Miss\nHighcamp played some selections from Grieg upon the piano. She seemed to\nhave apprehended all of the composer's coldness and none of his poetry.\nWhile Edna listened she could not help wondering if she had lost her\ntaste for music.</p>\n<p>When the time came for her to go home, Mr. Highcamp grunted a lame offer\nto escort her, looking down at his slippered feet with tactless concern.\nIt was Arobin who took her home. The car ride was long, and it was late\nwhen they reached Esplanade Street. Arobin asked permission to enter for\na second to light his cigarette--his match safe was empty. He filled his\nmatch safe, but did not light his cigarette until he left her, after she\nhad expressed her willingness to go to the races with him again.</p>\n<p>Edna was neither tired nor sleepy. She was hungry again, for the\nHighcamp dinner, though of excellent quality, had lacked abundance. She\nrummaged in the larder and brought forth a slice of Gruyere and some\ncrackers. She opened a bottle of beer which she found in the icebox.\nEdna felt extremely restless and excited. She vacantly hummed a\nfantastic tune as she poked at the wood embers on the hearth and munched\na cracker.</p>\n<p>She wanted something to happen--something, anything; she did not know\nwhat. She regretted that she had not made Arobin stay a half hour to\ntalk over the horses with her. She counted the money she had won. But\nthere was nothing else to do, so she went to bed, and tossed there for\nhours in a sort of monotonous agitation.</p>\n<p>In the middle of the night she remembered that she had forgotten to\nwrite her regular letter to her husband; and she decided to do so next\nday and tell him about her afternoon at the Jockey Club. She lay wide\nawake composing a letter which was nothing like the one which she wrote\nnext day. When the maid awoke her in the morning Edna was dreaming of\nMr. Highcamp playing the piano at the entrance of a music store on Canal\nStreet, while his wife was saying to Alcee Arobin, as they boarded an\nEsplanade Street car:</p>\n<p>“What a pity that so much talent has been neglected! but I must go.”</p>\n<p>When, a few days later, Alcee Arobin again called for Edna in his drag,\nMrs. Highcamp was not with him. He said they would pick her up. But as\nthat lady had not been apprised of his intention of picking her up, she\nwas not at home. The daughter was just leaving the house to attend the\nmeeting of a branch Folk Lore Society, and regretted that she could not\naccompany them. Arobin appeared nonplused, and asked Edna if there were\nany one else she cared to ask.</p>\n<p>She did not deem it worth while to go in search of any of the\nfashionable acquaintances from whom she had withdrawn herself. She\nthought of Madame Ratignolle, but knew that her fair friend did not\nleave the house, except to take a languid walk around the block with her\nhusband after nightfall. Mademoiselle Reisz would have laughed at such a\nrequest from Edna. Madame Lebrun might have enjoyed the outing, but for\nsome reason Edna did not want her. So they went alone, she and Arobin.</p>\n<p>The afternoon was intensely interesting to her. The excitement came\nback upon her like a remittent fever. Her talk grew familiar and\nconfidential. It was no labor to become intimate with Arobin. His manner\ninvited easy confidence. The preliminary stage of becoming acquainted\nwas one which he always endeavored to ignore when a pretty and engaging\nwoman was concerned.</p>\n<p>He stayed and dined with Edna. He stayed and sat beside the wood fire.\nThey laughed and talked; and before it was time to go he was telling\nher how different life might have been if he had known her years before.\nWith ingenuous frankness he spoke of what a wicked, ill-disciplined boy\nhe had been, and impulsively drew up his cuff to exhibit upon his wrist\nthe scar from a saber cut which he had received in a duel outside of\nParis when he was nineteen. She touched his hand as she scanned the red\ncicatrice on the inside of his white wrist. A quick impulse that was\nsomewhat spasmodic impelled her fingers to close in a sort of clutch\nupon his hand. He felt the pressure of her pointed nails in the flesh of\nhis palm.</p>\n<p>She arose hastily and walked toward the mantel.</p>\n<p>“The sight of a wound or scar always agitates and sickens me,” she said.\n“I shouldn't have looked at it.”</p>\n<p>“I beg your pardon,” he entreated, following her; “it never occurred to\nme that it might be repulsive.”</p>\n<p>He stood close to her, and the effrontery in his eyes repelled the old,\nvanishing self in her, yet drew all her awakening sensuousness. He saw\nenough in her face to impel him to take her hand and hold it while he\nsaid his lingering good night.</p>\n<p>“Will you go to the races again?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“No,” she said. “I've had enough of the races. I don't want to lose all\nthe money I've won, and I've got to work when the weather is bright,\ninstead of--”</p>\n<p>“Yes; work; to be sure. You promised to show me your work. What morning\nmay I come up to your atelier? To-morrow?”</p>\n<p>“No!”</p>\n<p>“Day after?”</p>\n<p>“No, no.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, please don't refuse me! I know something of such things. I might\nhelp you with a stray suggestion or two.”</p>\n<p>“No. Good night. Why don't you go after you have said good night? I\ndon't like you,” she went on in a high, excited pitch, attempting\nto draw away her hand. She felt that her words lacked dignity and\nsincerity, and she knew that he felt it.</p>\n<p>“I'm sorry you don't like me. I'm sorry I offended you. How have I\noffended you? What have I done? Can't you forgive me?” And he bent and\npressed his lips upon her hand as if he wished never more to withdraw\nthem.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Arobin,” she complained, “I'm greatly upset by the excitement of\nthe afternoon; I'm not myself. My manner must have misled you in some\nway. I wish you to go, please.” She spoke in a monotonous, dull tone.\nHe took his hat from the table, and stood with eyes turned from her,\nlooking into the dying fire. For a moment or two he kept an impressive\nsilence.</p>\n<p>“Your manner has not misled me, Mrs. Pontellier,” he said finally. “My\nown emotions have done that. I couldn't help it. When I'm near you, how\ncould I help it? Don't think anything of it, don't bother, please. You\nsee, I go when you command me. If you wish me to stay away, I shall do\nso. If you let me come back, I--oh! you will let me come back?”</p>\n<p>He cast one appealing glance at her, to which she made no response.\nAlcee Arobin's manner was so genuine that it often deceived even\nhimself.</p>\n<p>Edna did not care or think whether it were genuine or not. When she\nwas alone she looked mechanically at the back of her hand which he had\nkissed so warmly. Then she leaned her head down on the mantelpiece. She\nfelt somewhat like a woman who in a moment of passion is betrayed into\nan act of infidelity, and realizes the significance of the act without\nbeing wholly awakened from its glamour. The thought was passing vaguely\nthrough her mind, “What would he think?”</p>\n<p>She did not mean her husband; she was thinking of Robert Lebrun. Her\nhusband seemed to her now like a person whom she had married without\nlove as an excuse.</p>\n<p>She lit a candle and went up to her room. Alcee Arobin was absolutely\nnothing to her. Yet his presence, his manners, the warmth of his\nglances, and above all the touch of his lips upon her hand had acted\nlike a narcotic upon her.</p>\n<p>She slept a languorous sleep, interwoven with vanishing dreams.</p>\n<p>XXVI</p>\n<p>Alcee Arobin wrote Edna an elaborate note of apology, palpitant with\nsincerity. It embarrassed her; for in a cooler, quieter moment it\nappeared to her, absurd that she should have taken his action so\nseriously, so dramatically. She felt sure that the significance of the\nwhole occurrence had lain in her own self-consciousness. If she ignored\nhis note it would give undue importance to a trivial affair. If she\nreplied to it in a serious spirit it would still leave in his mind\nthe impression that she had in a susceptible moment yielded to his\ninfluence. After all, it was no great matter to have one's hand kissed.\nShe was provoked at his having written the apology. She answered in as\nlight and bantering a spirit as she fancied it deserved, and said she\nwould be glad to have him look in upon her at work whenever he felt the\ninclination and his business gave him the opportunity.</p>\n<p>He responded at once by presenting himself at her home with all his\ndisarming naivete. And then there was scarcely a day which followed\nthat she did not see him or was not reminded of him. He was prolific in\npretexts. His attitude became one of good-humored subservience and tacit\nadoration. He was ready at all times to submit to her moods, which were\nas often kind as they were cold. She grew accustomed to him. They became\nintimate and friendly by imperceptible degrees, and then by leaps. He\nsometimes talked in a way that astonished her at first and brought the\ncrimson into her face; in a way that pleased her at last, appealing to\nthe animalism that stirred impatiently within her.</p>\n<p>There was nothing which so quieted the turmoil of Edna's senses as\na visit to Mademoiselle Reisz. It was then, in the presence of that\npersonality which was offensive to her, that the woman, by her divine\nart, seemed to reach Edna's spirit and set it free.</p>\n<p>It was misty, with heavy, lowering atmosphere, one afternoon, when\nEdna climbed the stairs to the pianist's apartments under the roof. Her\nclothes were dripping with moisture. She felt chilled and pinched as she\nentered the room. Mademoiselle was poking at a rusty stove that smoked a\nlittle and warmed the room indifferently. She was endeavoring to heat\na pot of chocolate on the stove. The room looked cheerless and dingy to\nEdna as she entered. A bust of Beethoven, covered with a hood of dust,\nscowled at her from the mantelpiece.</p>\n<p>“Ah! here comes the sunlight!” exclaimed Mademoiselle, rising from her\nknees before the stove. “Now it will be warm and bright enough; I can\nlet the fire alone.”</p>\n<p>She closed the stove door with a bang, and approaching, assisted in\nremoving Edna's dripping mackintosh.</p>\n<p>“You are cold; you look miserable. The chocolate will soon be hot. But\nwould you rather have a taste of brandy? I have scarcely touched the\nbottle which you brought me for my cold.” A piece of red flannel was\nwrapped around Mademoiselle's throat; a stiff neck compelled her to hold\nher head on one side.</p>\n<p>“I will take some brandy,” said Edna, shivering as she removed her\ngloves and overshoes. She drank the liquor from the glass as a man would\nhave done. Then flinging herself upon the uncomfortable sofa she said,\n“Mademoiselle, I am going to move away from my house on Esplanade\nStreet.”</p>\n<p>“Ah!” ejaculated the musician, neither surprised nor especially\ninterested. Nothing ever seemed to astonish her very much. She was\nendeavoring to adjust the bunch of violets which had become loose from\nits fastening in her hair. Edna drew her down upon the sofa, and taking\na pin from her own hair, secured the shabby artificial flowers in their\naccustomed place.</p>\n<p>“Aren't you astonished?”</p>\n<p>“Passably. Where are you going? to New York? to Iberville? to your\nfather in Mississippi? where?”</p>\n<p>“Just two steps away,” laughed Edna, “in a little four-room house around\nthe corner. It looks so cozy, so inviting and restful, whenever I pass\nby; and it's for rent. I'm tired looking after that big house. It never\nseemed like mine, anyway--like home. It's too much trouble. I have to\nkeep too many servants. I am tired bothering with them.”</p>\n<p>“That is not your true reason, ma belle. There is no use in telling me\nlies. I don't know your reason, but you have not told me the truth.”\nEdna did not protest or endeavor to justify herself.</p>\n<p>“The house, the money that provides for it, are not mine. Isn't that\nenough reason?”</p>\n<p>“They are your husband's,” returned Mademoiselle, with a shrug and a\nmalicious elevation of the eyebrows.</p>\n<p>“Oh! I see there is no deceiving you. Then let me tell you: It is a\ncaprice. I have a little money of my own from my mother's estate, which\nmy father sends me by driblets. I won a large sum this winter on the\nraces, and I am beginning to sell my sketches. Laidpore is more and more\npleased with my work; he says it grows in force and individuality. I\ncannot judge of that myself, but I feel that I have gained in ease\nand confidence. However, as I said, I have sold a good many through\nLaidpore. I can live in the tiny house for little or nothing, with one\nservant. Old Celestine, who works occasionally for me, says she will\ncome stay with me and do my work. I know I shall like it, like the\nfeeling of freedom and independence.”</p>\n<p>“What does your husband say?”</p>\n<p>“I have not told him yet. I only thought of it this morning. He will\nthink I am demented, no doubt. Perhaps you think so.”</p>\n<p>Mademoiselle shook her head slowly. “Your reason is not yet clear to\nme,” she said.</p>\n<p>Neither was it quite clear to Edna herself; but it unfolded itself as\nshe sat for a while in silence. Instinct had prompted her to put away\nher husband's bounty in casting off her allegiance. She did not know how\nit would be when he returned. There would have to be an understanding,\nan explanation. Conditions would some way adjust themselves, she felt;\nbut whatever came, she had resolved never again to belong to another\nthan herself.</p>\n<p>“I shall give a grand dinner before I leave the old house!” Edna\nexclaimed. “You will have to come to it, Mademoiselle. I will give you\neverything that you like to eat and to drink. We shall sing and laugh\nand be merry for once.” And she uttered a sigh that came from the very\ndepths of her being.</p>\n<p>If Mademoiselle happened to have received a letter from Robert\nduring the interval of Edna's visits, she would give her the letter\nunsolicited. And she would seat herself at the piano and play as her\nhumor prompted her while the young woman read the letter.</p>\n<p>The little stove was roaring; it was red-hot, and the chocolate in the\ntin sizzled and sputtered. Edna went forward and opened the stove door,\nand Mademoiselle rising, took a letter from under the bust of Beethoven\nand handed it to Edna.</p>\n<p>“Another! so soon!” she exclaimed, her eyes filled with delight. “Tell\nme, Mademoiselle, does he know that I see his letters?”</p>\n<p>“Never in the world! He would be angry and would never write to me again\nif he thought so. Does he write to you? Never a line. Does he send you\na message? Never a word. It is because he loves you, poor fool, and\nis trying to forget you, since you are not free to listen to him or to\nbelong to him.”</p>\n<p>“Why do you show me his letters, then?”</p>\n<p>“Haven't you begged for them? Can I refuse you anything? Oh! you cannot\ndeceive me,” and Mademoiselle approached her beloved instrument and\nbegan to play. Edna did not at once read the letter. She sat holding\nit in her hand, while the music penetrated her whole being like an\neffulgence, warming and brightening the dark places of her soul. It\nprepared her for joy and exultation.</p>\n<p>“Oh!” she exclaimed, letting the letter fall to the floor. “Why did\nyou not tell me?” She went and grasped Mademoiselle's hands up from the\nkeys. “Oh! unkind! malicious! Why did you not tell me?”</p>\n<p>“That he was coming back? No great news, ma foi. I wonder he did not\ncome long ago.”</p>\n<p>“But when, when?” cried Edna, impatiently. “He does not say when.”</p>\n<p>“He says 'very soon.' You know as much about it as I do; it is all in\nthe letter.”</p>\n<p>“But why? Why is he coming? Oh, if I thought--” and she snatched the\nletter from the floor and turned the pages this way and that way,\nlooking for the reason, which was left untold.</p>\n<p>“If I were young and in love with a man,” said Mademoiselle, turning on\nthe stool and pressing her wiry hands between her knees as she looked\ndown at Edna, who sat on the floor holding the letter, “it seems to me\nhe would have to be some grand esprit; a man with lofty aims and ability\nto reach them; one who stood high enough to attract the notice of his\nfellow-men. It seems to me if I were young and in love I should never\ndeem a man of ordinary caliber worthy of my devotion.”</p>\n<p>“Now it is you who are telling lies and seeking to deceive me,\nMademoiselle; or else you have never been in love, and know nothing\nabout it. Why,” went on Edna, clasping her knees and looking up into\nMademoiselle's twisted face, “do you suppose a woman knows why she\nloves? Does she select? Does she say to herself: 'Go to! Here is a\ndistinguished statesman with presidential possibilities; I shall proceed\nto fall in love with him.' Or, 'I shall set my heart upon this musician,\nwhose fame is on every tongue?' Or, 'This financier, who controls the\nworld's money markets?'</p>\n<p>“You are purposely misunderstanding me, ma reine. Are you in love with\nRobert?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Edna. It was the first time she had admitted it, and a glow\noverspread her face, blotching it with red spots.</p>\n<p>“Why?” asked her companion. “Why do you love him when you ought not to?”</p>\n<p>Edna, with a motion or two, dragged herself on her knees before\nMademoiselle Reisz, who took the glowing face between her two hands.</p>\n<p>“Why? Because his hair is brown and grows away from his temples; because\nhe opens and shuts his eyes, and his nose is a little out of drawing;\nbecause he has two lips and a square chin, and a little finger which he\ncan't straighten from having played baseball too energetically in his\nyouth. Because--”</p>\n<p>“Because you do, in short,” laughed Mademoiselle. “What will you do when\nhe comes back?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Do? Nothing, except feel glad and happy to be alive.”</p>\n<p>She was already glad and happy to be alive at the mere thought of his\nreturn. The murky, lowering sky, which had depressed her a few hours\nbefore, seemed bracing and invigorating as she splashed through the\nstreets on her way home.</p>\n<p>She stopped at a confectioner's and ordered a huge box of bonbons for\nthe children in Iberville. She slipped a card in the box, on which she\nscribbled a tender message and sent an abundance of kisses.</p>\n<p>Before dinner in the evening Edna wrote a charming letter to her\nhusband, telling him of her intention to move for a while into the\nlittle house around the block, and to give a farewell dinner before\nleaving, regretting that he was not there to share it, to help out\nwith the menu and assist her in entertaining the guests. Her letter was\nbrilliant and brimming with cheerfulness.</p>\n<p>XXVII</p>\n<p>“What is the matter with you?” asked Arobin that evening. “I never\nfound you in such a happy mood.” Edna was tired by that time, and was\nreclining on the lounge before the fire.</p>\n<p>“Don't you know the weather prophet has told us we shall see the sun\npretty soon?”</p>\n<p>“Well, that ought to be reason enough,” he acquiesced. “You wouldn't\ngive me another if I sat here all night imploring you.” He sat close to\nher on a low tabouret, and as he spoke his fingers lightly touched the\nhair that fell a little over her forehead. She liked the touch of his\nfingers through her hair, and closed her eyes sensitively.</p>\n<p>“One of these days,” she said, “I'm going to pull myself together for a\nwhile and think--try to determine what character of a woman I am; for,\ncandidly, I don't know. By all the codes which I am acquainted with,\nI am a devilishly wicked specimen of the sex. But some way I can't\nconvince myself that I am. I must think about it.”</p>\n<p>“Don't. What's the use? Why should you bother thinking about it when\nI can tell you what manner of woman you are.” His fingers strayed\noccasionally down to her warm, smooth cheeks and firm chin, which was\ngrowing a little full and double.</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes! You will tell me that I am adorable; everything that is\ncaptivating. Spare yourself the effort.”</p>\n<p>“No; I shan't tell you anything of the sort, though I shouldn't be lying\nif I did.”</p>\n<p>“Do you know Mademoiselle Reisz?” she asked irrelevantly.</p>\n<p>“The pianist? I know her by sight. I've heard her play.”</p>\n<p>“She says queer things sometimes in a bantering way that you don't\nnotice at the time and you find yourself thinking about afterward.”</p>\n<p>“For instance?”</p>\n<p>“Well, for instance, when I left her to-day, she put her arms around me\nand felt my shoulder blades, to see if my wings were strong, she\nsaid. 'The bird that would soar above the level plain of tradition\nand prejudice must have strong wings. It is a sad spectacle to see the\nweaklings bruised, exhausted, fluttering back to earth.' Whither would\nyou soar?”</p>\n<p>“I'm not thinking of any extraordinary flights. I only half comprehend\nher.”</p>\n<p>“I've heard she's partially demented,” said Arobin.</p>\n<p>“She seems to me wonderfully sane,” Edna replied.</p>\n<p>“I'm told she's extremely disagreeable and unpleasant. Why have you\nintroduced her at a moment when I desired to talk of you?”</p>\n<p>“Oh! talk of me if you like,” cried Edna, clasping her hands beneath her\nhead; “but let me think of something else while you do.”</p>\n<p>“I'm jealous of your thoughts tonight. They're making you a little\nkinder than usual; but some way I feel as if they were wandering, as if\nthey were not here with me.” She only looked at him and smiled. His eyes\nwere very near. He leaned upon the lounge with an arm extended across\nher, while the other hand still rested upon her hair. They continued\nsilently to look into each other's eyes. When he leaned forward and\nkissed her, she clasped his head, holding his lips to hers.</p>\n<p>It was the first kiss of her life to which her nature had really\nresponded. It was a flaming torch that kindled desire.</p>\n<p>XXVIII</p>\n<p>Edna cried a little that night after Arobin left her. It was only one\nphase of the multitudinous emotions which had assailed her. There was\nwith her an overwhelming feeling of irresponsibility. There was the\nshock of the unexpected and the unaccustomed. There was her husband's\nreproach looking at her from the external things around her which he had\nprovided for her external existence. There was Robert's reproach making\nitself felt by a quicker, fiercer, more overpowering love, which had\nawakened within her toward him. Above all, there was understanding. She\nfelt as if a mist had been lifted from her eyes, enabling her to took\nupon and comprehend the significance of life, that monster made up\nof beauty and brutality. But among the conflicting sensations which\nassailed her, there was neither shame nor remorse. There was a dull pang\nof regret because it was not the kiss of love which had inflamed her,\nbecause it was not love which had held this cup of life to her lips.</p>\n<p>XXIX</p>\n<p>Without even waiting for an answer from her husband regarding his\nopinion or wishes in the matter, Edna hastened her preparations for\nquitting her home on Esplanade Street and moving into the little house\naround the block. A feverish anxiety attended her every action in that\ndirection. There was no moment of deliberation, no interval of repose\nbetween the thought and its fulfillment. Early upon the morning\nfollowing those hours passed in Arobin's society, Edna set about\nsecuring her new abode and hurrying her arrangements for occupying it.\nWithin the precincts of her home she felt like one who has entered and\nlingered within the portals of some forbidden temple in which a thousand\nmuffled voices bade her begone.</p>\n<p>Whatever was her own in the house, everything which she had acquired\naside from her husband's bounty, she caused to be transported to the\nother house, supplying simple and meager deficiencies from her own\nresources.</p>\n<p>Arobin found her with rolled sleeves, working in company with the\nhouse-maid when he looked in during the afternoon. She was splendid and\nrobust, and had never appeared handsomer than in the old blue gown, with\na red silk handkerchief knotted at random around her head to protect her\nhair from the dust. She was mounted upon a high stepladder, unhooking a\npicture from the wall when he entered. He had found the front door open,\nand had followed his ring by walking in unceremoniously.</p>\n<p>“Come down!” he said. “Do you want to kill yourself?” She greeted him\nwith affected carelessness, and appeared absorbed in her occupation.</p>\n<p>If he had expected to find her languishing, reproachful, or indulging in\nsentimental tears, he must have been greatly surprised.</p>\n<p>He was no doubt prepared for any emergency, ready for any one of the\nforegoing attitudes, just as he bent himself easily and naturally to the\nsituation which confronted him.</p>\n<p>“Please come down,” he insisted, holding the ladder and looking up at\nher.</p>\n<p>“No,” she answered; “Ellen is afraid to mount the ladder. Joe is working\nover at the 'pigeon house'--that's the name Ellen gives it, because it's\nso small and looks like a pigeon house--and some one has to do this.”</p>\n<p>Arobin pulled off his coat, and expressed himself ready and willing to\ntempt fate in her place. Ellen brought him one of her dust-caps,\nand went into contortions of mirth, which she found it impossible to\ncontrol, when she saw him put it on before the mirror as grotesquely as\nhe could. Edna herself could not refrain from smiling when she fastened\nit at his request. So it was he who in turn mounted the ladder,\nunhooking pictures and curtains, and dislodging ornaments as Edna\ndirected. When he had finished he took off his dust-cap and went out to\nwash his hands.</p>\n<p>Edna was sitting on the tabouret, idly brushing the tips of a feather\nduster along the carpet when he came in again.</p>\n<p>“Is there anything more you will let me do?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“That is all,” she answered. “Ellen can manage the rest.” She kept the\nyoung woman occupied in the drawing-room, unwilling to be left alone\nwith Arobin.</p>\n<p>“What about the dinner?” he asked; “the grand event, the coup d'etat?”</p>\n<p>“It will be day after to-morrow. Why do you call it the 'coup d'etat?'\nOh! it will be very fine; all my best of everything--crystal, silver and\ngold, Sevres, flowers, music, and champagne to swim in. I'll let Leonce\npay the bills. I wonder what he'll say when he sees the bills.</p>\n<p>“And you ask me why I call it a coup d'etat?” Arobin had put on his\ncoat, and he stood before her and asked if his cravat was plumb. She\ntold him it was, looking no higher than the tip of his collar.</p>\n<p>“When do you go to the 'pigeon house?'--with all due acknowledgment to\nEllen.”</p>\n<p>“Day after to-morrow, after the dinner. I shall sleep there.”</p>\n<p>“Ellen, will you very kindly get me a glass of water?” asked Arobin.\n“The dust in the curtains, if you will pardon me for hinting such a\nthing, has parched my throat to a crisp.”</p>\n<p>“While Ellen gets the water,” said Edna, rising, “I will say good-by and\nlet you go. I must get rid of this grime, and I have a million things to\ndo and think of.”</p>\n<p>“When shall I see you?” asked Arobin, seeking to detain her, the maid\nhaving left the room.</p>\n<p>“At the dinner, of course. You are invited.”</p>\n<p>“Not before?--not to-night or to-morrow morning or tomorrow noon or\nnight? or the day after morning or noon? Can't you see yourself, without\nmy telling you, what an eternity it is?”</p>\n<p>He had followed her into the hall and to the foot of the stairway,\nlooking up at her as she mounted with her face half turned to him.</p>\n<p>“Not an instant sooner,” she said. But she laughed and looked at him\nwith eyes that at once gave him courage to wait and made it torture to\nwait.</p>\n<p>XXX</p>\n<p>Though Edna had spoken of the dinner as a very grand affair, it was\nin truth a very small affair and very select, in so much as the guests\ninvited were few and were selected with discrimination. She had counted\nupon an even dozen seating themselves at her round mahogany board,\nforgetting for the moment that Madame Ratignolle was to the last degree\nsouffrante and unpresentable, and not foreseeing that Madame Lebrun\nwould send a thousand regrets at the last moment. So there were only\nten, after all, which made a cozy, comfortable number.</p>\n<p>There were Mr. and Mrs. Merriman, a pretty, vivacious little woman in\nthe thirties; her husband, a jovial fellow, something of a shallow-pate,\nwho laughed a good deal at other people's witticisms, and had thereby\nmade himself extremely popular. Mrs. Highcamp had accompanied them. Of\ncourse, there was Alcee Arobin; and Mademoiselle Reisz had consented\nto come. Edna had sent her a fresh bunch of violets with black lace\ntrimmings for her hair. Monsieur Ratignolle brought himself and his\nwife's excuses. Victor Lebrun, who happened to be in the city, bent upon\nrelaxation, had accepted with alacrity. There was a Miss Mayblunt, no\nlonger in her teens, who looked at the world through lorgnettes and with\nthe keenest interest. It was thought and said that she was intellectual;\nit was suspected of her that she wrote under a nom de guerre. She had\ncome with a gentleman by the name of Gouvernail, connected with one of\nthe daily papers, of whom nothing special could be said, except that he\nwas observant and seemed quiet and inoffensive. Edna herself made the\ntenth, and at half-past eight they seated themselves at table, Arobin\nand Monsieur Ratignolle on either side of their hostess.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Highcamp sat between Arobin and Victor Lebrun. Then came Mrs.\nMerriman, Mr. Gouvernail, Miss Mayblunt, Mr. Merriman, and Mademoiselle\nReisz next to Monsieur Ratignolle.</p>\n<p>There was something extremely gorgeous about the appearance of the\ntable, an effect of splendor conveyed by a cover of pale yellow satin\nunder strips of lace-work. There were wax candles, in massive brass\ncandelabra, burning softly under yellow silk shades; full, fragrant\nroses, yellow and red, abounded. There were silver and gold, as she had\nsaid there would be, and crystal which glittered like the gems which the\nwomen wore.</p>\n<p>The ordinary stiff dining chairs had been discarded for the occasion and\nreplaced by the most commodious and luxurious which could be collected\nthroughout the house. Mademoiselle Reisz, being exceedingly diminutive,\nwas elevated upon cushions, as small children are sometimes hoisted at\ntable upon bulky volumes.</p>\n<p>“Something new, Edna?” exclaimed Miss Mayblunt, with lorgnette directed\ntoward a magnificent cluster of diamonds that sparkled, that almost\nsputtered, in Edna's hair, just over the center of her forehead.</p>\n<p>“Quite new; 'brand' new, in fact; a present from my husband. It\narrived this morning from New York. I may as well admit that this is my\nbirthday, and that I am twenty-nine. In good time I expect you to drink\nmy health. Meanwhile, I shall ask you to begin with this cocktail,\ncomposed--would you say 'composed?'” with an appeal to Miss\nMayblunt--“composed by my father in honor of Sister Janet's wedding.”</p>\n<p>Before each guest stood a tiny glass that looked and sparkled like a\ngarnet gem.</p>\n<p>“Then, all things considered,” spoke Arobin, “it might not be amiss\nto start out by drinking the Colonel's health in the cocktail which he\ncomposed, on the birthday of the most charming of women--the daughter\nwhom he invented.”</p>\n<p>Mr. Merriman's laugh at this sally was such a genuine outburst and so\ncontagious that it started the dinner with an agreeable swing that never\nslackened.</p>\n<p>Miss Mayblunt begged to be allowed to keep her cocktail untouched before\nher, just to look at. The color was marvelous! She could compare it to\nnothing she had ever seen, and the garnet lights which it emitted were\nunspeakably rare. She pronounced the Colonel an artist, and stuck to it.</p>\n<p>Monsieur Ratignolle was prepared to take things seriously; the mets, the\nentre-mets, the service, the decorations, even the people. He looked\nup from his pompano and inquired of Arobin if he were related to the\ngentleman of that name who formed one of the firm of Laitner and Arobin,\nlawyers. The young man admitted that Laitner was a warm personal friend,\nwho permitted Arobin's name to decorate the firm's letterheads and to\nappear upon a shingle that graced Perdido Street.</p>\n<p>“There are so many inquisitive people and institutions abounding,” said\nArobin, “that one is really forced as a matter of convenience these\ndays to assume the virtue of an occupation if he has it not.” Monsieur\nRatignolle stared a little, and turned to ask Mademoiselle Reisz if she\nconsidered the symphony concerts up to the standard which had been set\nthe previous winter. Mademoiselle Reisz answered Monsieur Ratignolle in\nFrench, which Edna thought a little rude, under the circumstances, but\ncharacteristic. Mademoiselle had only disagreeable things to say of the\nsymphony concerts, and insulting remarks to make of all the musicians\nof New Orleans, singly and collectively. All her interest seemed to be\ncentered upon the delicacies placed before her.</p>\n<p>Mr. Merriman said that Mr. Arobin's remark about inquisitive people\nreminded him of a man from Waco the other day at the St. Charles\nHotel--but as Mr. Merriman's stories were always lame and lacking point,\nhis wife seldom permitted him to complete them. She interrupted him to\nask if he remembered the name of the author whose book she had bought\nthe week before to send to a friend in Geneva. She was talking “books”\nwith Mr. Gouvernail and trying to draw from him his opinion upon current\nliterary topics. Her husband told the story of the Waco man privately\nto Miss Mayblunt, who pretended to be greatly amused and to think it\nextremely clever.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Highcamp hung with languid but unaffected interest upon the warm\nand impetuous volubility of her left-hand neighbor, Victor Lebrun.\nHer attention was never for a moment withdrawn from him after seating\nherself at table; and when he turned to Mrs. Merriman, who was prettier\nand more vivacious than Mrs. Highcamp, she waited with easy indifference\nfor an opportunity to reclaim his attention. There was the occasional\nsound of music, of mandolins, sufficiently removed to be an agreeable\naccompaniment rather than an interruption to the conversation. Outside\nthe soft, monotonous splash of a fountain could be heard; the sound\npenetrated into the room with the heavy odor of jessamine that came\nthrough the open windows.</p>\n<p>The golden shimmer of Edna's satin gown spread in rich folds on either\nside of her. There was a soft fall of lace encircling her shoulders.\nIt was the color of her skin, without the glow, the myriad living tints\nthat one may sometimes discover in vibrant flesh. There was something in\nher attitude, in her whole appearance when she leaned her head against\nthe high-backed chair and spread her arms, which suggested the regal\nwoman, the one who rules, who looks on, who stands alone.</p>\n<p>But as she sat there amid her guests, she felt the old ennui overtaking\nher; the hopelessness which so often assailed her, which came upon her\nlike an obsession, like something extraneous, independent of volition.\nIt was something which announced itself; a chill breath that seemed to\nissue from some vast cavern wherein discords waited. There came over her\nthe acute longing which always summoned into her spiritual vision the\npresence of the beloved one, overpowering her at once with a sense of\nthe unattainable.</p>\n<p>The moments glided on, while a feeling of good fellowship passed around\nthe circle like a mystic cord, holding and binding these people together\nwith jest and laughter. Monsieur Ratignolle was the first to break the\npleasant charm. At ten o'clock he excused himself. Madame Ratignolle\nwas waiting for him at home. She was bien souffrante, and she was filled\nwith vague dread, which only her husband's presence could allay.</p>\n<p>Mademoiselle Reisz arose with Monsieur Ratignolle, who offered to escort\nher to the car. She had eaten well; she had tasted the good, rich wines,\nand they must have turned her head, for she bowed pleasantly to all\nas she withdrew from table. She kissed Edna upon the shoulder, and\nwhispered: “Bonne nuit, ma reine; soyez sage.” She had been a little\nbewildered upon rising, or rather, descending from her cushions, and\nMonsieur Ratignolle gallantly took her arm and led her away.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Highcamp was weaving a garland of roses, yellow and red. When she\nhad finished the garland, she laid it lightly upon Victor's black curls.\nHe was reclining far back in the luxurious chair, holding a glass of\nchampagne to the light.</p>\n<p>As if a magician's wand had touched him, the garland of roses\ntransformed him into a vision of Oriental beauty. His cheeks were the\ncolor of crushed grapes, and his dusky eyes glowed with a languishing\nfire.</p>\n<p>“Sapristi!” exclaimed Arobin.</p>\n<p>But Mrs. Highcamp had one more touch to add to the picture. She took\nfrom the back of her chair a white silken scarf, with which she had\ncovered her shoulders in the early part of the evening. She draped it\nacross the boy in graceful folds, and in a way to conceal his black,\nconventional evening dress. He did not seem to mind what she did to him,\nonly smiled, showing a faint gleam of white teeth, while he continued to\ngaze with narrowing eyes at the light through his glass of champagne.</p>\n<p>“Oh! to be able to paint in color rather than in words!” exclaimed Miss\nMayblunt, losing herself in a rhapsodic dream as she looked at him.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">     “&#39;There was a graven image of Desire\n      Painted with red blood on a ground of gold.&#39;”</code></pre></div>\n<p>murmured Gouvernail, under his breath.</p>\n<p>The effect of the wine upon Victor was to change his accustomed\nvolubility into silence. He seemed to have abandoned himself to a\nreverie, and to be seeing pleasing visions in the amber bead.</p>\n<p>“Sing,” entreated Mrs. Highcamp. “Won't you sing to us?”</p>\n<p>“Let him alone,” said Arobin.</p>\n<p>“He's posing,” offered Mr. Merriman; “let him have it out.”</p>\n<p>“I believe he's paralyzed,” laughed Mrs. Merriman. And leaning over the\nyouth's chair, she took the glass from his hand and held it to his lips.\nHe sipped the wine slowly, and when he had drained the glass she laid it\nupon the table and wiped his lips with her little filmy handkerchief.</p>\n<p>“Yes, I'll sing for you,” he said, turning in his chair toward Mrs.\nHighcamp. He clasped his hands behind his head, and looking up at the\nceiling began to hum a little, trying his voice like a musician tuning\nan instrument. Then, looking at Edna, he began to sing:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\"> “Ah! si tu savais!”</code></pre></div>\n<p>“Stop!” she cried, “don't sing that. I don't want you to sing it,”\nand she laid her glass so impetuously and blindly upon the table as to\nshatter it against a carafe. The wine spilled over Arobin's legs and\nsome of it trickled down upon Mrs. Highcamp's black gauze gown. Victor\nhad lost all idea of courtesy, or else he thought his hostess was not in\nearnest, for he laughed and went on:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\"> “Ah! si tu savais\n\n Ce que tes yeux me disent”--</code></pre></div>\n<p>“Oh! you mustn't! you mustn't,” exclaimed Edna, and pushing back her\nchair she got up, and going behind him placed her hand over his mouth.\nHe kissed the soft palm that pressed upon his lips.</p>\n<p>“No, no, I won't, Mrs. Pontellier. I didn't know you meant it,” looking\nup at her with caressing eyes. The touch of his lips was like a pleasing\nsting to her hand. She lifted the garland of roses from his head and\nflung it across the room.</p>\n<p>“Come, Victor; you've posed long enough. Give Mrs. Highcamp her scarf.”</p>\n<p>Mrs. Highcamp undraped the scarf from about him with her own hands. Miss\nMayblunt and Mr. Gouvernail suddenly conceived the notion that it was\ntime to say good night. And Mr. and Mrs. Merriman wondered how it could\nbe so late.</p>\n<p>Before parting from Victor, Mrs. Highcamp invited him to call upon her\ndaughter, who she knew would be charmed to meet him and talk French and\nsing French songs with him. Victor expressed his desire and intention to\ncall upon Miss Highcamp at the first opportunity which presented itself.\nHe asked if Arobin were going his way. Arobin was not.</p>\n<p>The mandolin players had long since stolen away. A profound stillness\nhad fallen upon the broad, beautiful street. The voices of Edna's\ndisbanding guests jarred like a discordant note upon the quiet harmony\nof the night.</p>\n<p>XXXI</p>\n<p>“Well?” questioned Arobin, who had remained with Edna after the others\nhad departed.</p>\n<p>“Well,” she reiterated, and stood up, stretching her arms, and feeling\nthe need to relax her muscles after having been so long seated.</p>\n<p>“What next?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“The servants are all gone. They left when the musicians did. I have\ndismissed them. The house has to be closed and locked, and I shall trot\naround to the pigeon house, and shall send Celestine over in the morning\nto straighten things up.”</p>\n<p>He looked around, and began to turn out some of the lights.</p>\n<p>“What about upstairs?” he inquired.</p>\n<p>“I think it is all right; but there may be a window or two unlatched. We\nhad better look; you might take a candle and see. And bring me my wrap\nand hat on the foot of the bed in the middle room.”</p>\n<p>He went up with the light, and Edna began closing doors and windows. She\nhated to shut in the smoke and the fumes of the wine. Arobin found her\ncape and hat, which he brought down and helped her to put on.</p>\n<p>When everything was secured and the lights put out, they left through\nthe front door, Arobin locking it and taking the key, which he carried\nfor Edna. He helped her down the steps.</p>\n<p>“Will you have a spray of jessamine?” he asked, breaking off a few\nblossoms as he passed.</p>\n<p>“No; I don't want anything.”</p>\n<p>She seemed disheartened, and had nothing to say. She took his arm, which\nhe offered her, holding up the weight of her satin train with the other\nhand. She looked down, noticing the black line of his leg moving in and\nout so close to her against the yellow shimmer of her gown. There\nwas the whistle of a railway train somewhere in the distance, and the\nmidnight bells were ringing. They met no one in their short walk.</p>\n<p>The “pigeon house” stood behind a locked gate, and a shallow parterre\nthat had been somewhat neglected. There was a small front porch, upon\nwhich a long window and the front door opened. The door opened directly\ninto the parlor; there was no side entry. Back in the yard was a room\nfor servants, in which old Celestine had been ensconced.</p>\n<p>Edna had left a lamp burning low upon the table. She had succeeded in\nmaking the room look habitable and homelike. There were some books on\nthe table and a lounge near at hand. On the floor was a fresh matting,\ncovered with a rug or two; and on the walls hung a few tasteful\npictures. But the room was filled with flowers. These were a surprise to\nher. Arobin had sent them, and had had Celestine distribute them during\nEdna's absence. Her bedroom was adjoining, and across a small passage\nwere the dining-room and kitchen.</p>\n<p>Edna seated herself with every appearance of discomfort.</p>\n<p>“Are you tired?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes, and chilled, and miserable. I feel as if I had been wound up to a\ncertain pitch--too tight--and something inside of me had snapped.” She\nrested her head against the table upon her bare arm.</p>\n<p>“You want to rest,” he said, “and to be quiet. I'll go; I'll leave you\nand let you rest.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” she replied.</p>\n<p>He stood up beside her and smoothed her hair with his soft, magnetic\nhand. His touch conveyed to her a certain physical comfort. She could\nhave fallen quietly asleep there if he had continued to pass his hand\nover her hair. He brushed the hair upward from the nape of her neck.</p>\n<p>“I hope you will feel better and happier in the morning,” he said. “You\nhave tried to do too much in the past few days. The dinner was the last\nstraw; you might have dispensed with it.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” she admitted; “it was stupid.”</p>\n<p>“No, it was delightful; but it has worn you out.” His hand had strayed\nto her beautiful shoulders, and he could feel the response of her flesh\nto his touch. He seated himself beside her and kissed her lightly upon\nthe shoulder.</p>\n<p>“I thought you were going away,” she said, in an uneven voice.</p>\n<p>“I am, after I have said good night.”</p>\n<p>“Good night,” she murmured.</p>\n<p>He did not answer, except to continue to caress her. He did not say good\nnight until she had become supple to his gentle, seductive entreaties.</p>\n<p>XXXII</p>\n<p>When Mr. Pontellier learned of his wife's intention to abandon her home\nand take up her residence elsewhere, he immediately wrote her a letter\nof unqualified disapproval and remonstrance. She had given reasons which\nhe was unwilling to acknowledge as adequate. He hoped she had not acted\nupon her rash impulse; and he begged her to consider first, foremost,\nand above all else, what people would say. He was not dreaming of\nscandal when he uttered this warning; that was a thing which would never\nhave entered into his mind to consider in connection with his wife's\nname or his own. He was simply thinking of his financial integrity. It\nmight get noised about that the Pontelliers had met with reverses, and\nwere forced to conduct their menage on a humbler scale than heretofore.\nIt might do incalculable mischief to his business prospects.</p>\n<p>But remembering Edna's whimsical turn of mind of late, and foreseeing\nthat she had immediately acted upon her impetuous determination, he\ngrasped the situation with his usual promptness and handled it with his\nwell-known business tact and cleverness.</p>\n<p>The same mail which brought to Edna his letter of disapproval carried\ninstructions--the most minute instructions--to a well-known architect\nconcerning the remodeling of his home, changes which he had long\ncontemplated, and which he desired carried forward during his temporary\nabsence.</p>\n<p>Expert and reliable packers and movers were engaged to convey the\nfurniture, carpets, pictures--everything movable, in short--to places\nof security. And in an incredibly short time the Pontellier house\nwas turned over to the artisans. There was to be an addition--a small\nsnuggery; there was to be frescoing, and hardwood flooring was to be put\ninto such rooms as had not yet been subjected to this improvement.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, in one of the daily papers appeared a brief notice to the\neffect that Mr. and Mrs. Pontellier were contemplating a summer sojourn\nabroad, and that their handsome residence on Esplanade Street was\nundergoing sumptuous alterations, and would not be ready for occupancy\nuntil their return. Mr. Pontellier had saved appearances!</p>\n<p>Edna admired the skill of his maneuver, and avoided any occasion to balk\nhis intentions. When the situation as set forth by Mr. Pontellier was\naccepted and taken for granted, she was apparently satisfied that it\nshould be so.</p>\n<p>The pigeon house pleased her. It at once assumed the intimate character\nof a home, while she herself invested it with a charm which it reflected\nlike a warm glow. There was with her a feeling of having descended in\nthe social scale, with a corresponding sense of having risen in the\nspiritual. Every step which she took toward relieving herself from\nobligations added to her strength and expansion as an individual. She\nbegan to look with her own eyes; to see and to apprehend the deeper\nundercurrents of life. No longer was she content to “feed upon opinion”\nwhen her own soul had invited her.</p>\n<p>After a little while, a few days, in fact, Edna went up and spent a week\nwith her children in Iberville. They were delicious February days, with\nall the summer's promise hovering in the air.</p>\n<p>How glad she was to see the children! She wept for very pleasure when\nshe felt their little arms clasping her; their hard, ruddy cheeks\npressed against her own glowing cheeks. She looked into their faces with\nhungry eyes that could not be satisfied with looking. And what stories\nthey had to tell their mother! About the pigs, the cows, the mules!\nAbout riding to the mill behind Gluglu; fishing back in the lake with\ntheir Uncle Jasper; picking pecans with Lidie's little black brood, and\nhauling chips in their express wagon. It was a thousand times more fun\nto haul real chips for old lame Susie's real fire than to drag painted\nblocks along the banquette on Esplanade Street!</p>\n<p>She went with them herself to see the pigs and the cows, to look at the\ndarkies laying the cane, to thrash the pecan trees, and catch fish in\nthe back lake. She lived with them a whole week long, giving them all of\nherself, and gathering and filling herself with their young existence.\nThey listened, breathless, when she told them the house in Esplanade\nStreet was crowded with workmen, hammering, nailing, sawing, and filling\nthe place with clatter. They wanted to know where their bed was; what\nhad been done with their rocking-horse; and where did Joe sleep, and\nwhere had Ellen gone, and the cook? But, above all, they were fired with\na desire to see the little house around the block. Was there any\nplace to play? Were there any boys next door? Raoul, with pessimistic\nforeboding, was convinced that there were only girls next door. Where\nwould they sleep, and where would papa sleep? She told them the fairies\nwould fix it all right.</p>\n<p>The old Madame was charmed with Edna's visit, and showered all manner\nof delicate attentions upon her. She was delighted to know that the\nEsplanade Street house was in a dismantled condition. It gave her the\npromise and pretext to keep the children indefinitely.</p>\n<p>It was with a wrench and a pang that Edna left her children. She carried\naway with her the sound of their voices and the touch of their cheeks.\nAll along the journey homeward their presence lingered with her like the\nmemory of a delicious song. But by the time she had regained the city\nthe song no longer echoed in her soul. She was again alone.</p>\n<p>XXXIII</p>\n<p>It happened sometimes when Edna went to see Mademoiselle Reisz that\nthe little musician was absent, giving a lesson or making some small\nnecessary household purchase. The key was always left in a secret\nhiding-place in the entry, which Edna knew. If Mademoiselle happened to\nbe away, Edna would usually enter and wait for her return.</p>\n<p>When she knocked at Mademoiselle Reisz's door one afternoon there was\nno response; so unlocking the door, as usual, she entered and found the\napartment deserted, as she had expected. Her day had been quite filled\nup, and it was for a rest, for a refuge, and to talk about Robert, that\nshe sought out her friend.</p>\n<p>She had worked at her canvas--a young Italian character study--all the\nmorning, completing the work without the model; but there had been many\ninterruptions, some incident to her modest housekeeping, and others of a\nsocial nature.</p>\n<p>Madame Ratignolle had dragged herself over, avoiding the too public\nthoroughfares, she said. She complained that Edna had neglected her\nmuch of late. Besides, she was consumed with curiosity to see the little\nhouse and the manner in which it was conducted. She wanted to hear all\nabout the dinner party; Monsieur Ratignolle had left so early. What had\nhappened after he left? The champagne and grapes which Edna sent over\nwere TOO delicious. She had so little appetite; they had refreshed and\ntoned her stomach. Where on earth was she going to put Mr. Pontellier in\nthat little house, and the boys? And then she made Edna promise to go to\nher when her hour of trial overtook her.</p>\n<p>“At any time--any time of the day or night, dear,” Edna assured her.</p>\n<p>Before leaving Madame Ratignolle said:</p>\n<p>“In some way you seem to me like a child, Edna. You seem to act without\na certain amount of reflection which is necessary in this life. That is\nthe reason I want to say you mustn't mind if I advise you to be a little\ncareful while you are living here alone. Why don't you have some one\ncome and stay with you? Wouldn't Mademoiselle Reisz come?”</p>\n<p>“No; she wouldn't wish to come, and I shouldn't want her always with\nme.”</p>\n<p>“Well, the reason--you know how evil-minded the world is--some one was\ntalking of Alcee Arobin visiting you. Of course, it wouldn't matter if\nMr. Arobin had not such a dreadful reputation. Monsieur Ratignolle was\ntelling me that his attentions alone are considered enough to ruin a\nwoman's name.”</p>\n<p>“Does he boast of his successes?” asked Edna, indifferently, squinting\nat her picture.</p>\n<p>“No, I think not. I believe he is a decent fellow as far as that goes.\nBut his character is so well known among the men. I shan't be able to\ncome back and see you; it was very, very imprudent to-day.”</p>\n<p>“Mind the step!” cried Edna.</p>\n<p>“Don't neglect me,” entreated Madame Ratignolle; “and don't mind what I\nsaid about Arobin, or having some one to stay with you.</p>\n<p>“Of course not,” Edna laughed. “You may say anything you like to me.”\nThey kissed each other good-by. Madame Ratignolle had not far to go, and\nEdna stood on the porch a while watching her walk down the street.</p>\n<p>Then in the afternoon Mrs. Merriman and Mrs. Highcamp had made their\n“party call.” Edna felt that they might have dispensed with the\nformality. They had also come to invite her to play vingt-et-un one\nevening at Mrs. Merriman's. She was asked to go early, to dinner, and\nMr. Merriman or Mr. Arobin would take her home. Edna accepted in a\nhalf-hearted way. She sometimes felt very tired of Mrs. Highcamp and\nMrs. Merriman.</p>\n<p>Late in the afternoon she sought refuge with Mademoiselle Reisz, and\nstayed there alone, waiting for her, feeling a kind of repose invade her\nwith the very atmosphere of the shabby, unpretentious little room.</p>\n<p>Edna sat at the window, which looked out over the house-tops and across\nthe river. The window frame was filled with pots of flowers, and she sat\nand picked the dry leaves from a rose geranium. The day was warm, and\nthe breeze which blew from the river was very pleasant. She removed her\nhat and laid it on the piano. She went on picking the leaves and\ndigging around the plants with her hat pin. Once she thought she heard\nMademoiselle Reisz approaching. But it was a young black girl, who\ncame in, bringing a small bundle of laundry, which she deposited in the\nadjoining room, and went away.</p>\n<p>Edna seated herself at the piano, and softly picked out with one hand\nthe bars of a piece of music which lay open before her. A half-hour went\nby. There was the occasional sound of people going and coming in the\nlower hall. She was growing interested in her occupation of picking out\nthe aria, when there was a second rap at the door. She vaguely wondered\nwhat these people did when they found Mademoiselle's door locked.</p>\n<p>“Come in,” she called, turning her face toward the door. And this time\nit was Robert Lebrun who presented himself. She attempted to rise; she\ncould not have done so without betraying the agitation which mastered\nher at sight of him, so she fell back upon the stool, only exclaiming,\n“Why, Robert!”</p>\n<p>He came and clasped her hand, seemingly without knowing what he was\nsaying or doing.</p>\n<p>“Mrs. Pontellier! How do you happen--oh! how well you look! Is\nMademoiselle Reisz not here? I never expected to see you.”</p>\n<p>“When did you come back?” asked Edna in an unsteady voice, wiping her\nface with her handkerchief. She seemed ill at ease on the piano stool,\nand he begged her to take the chair by the window.</p>\n<p>She did so, mechanically, while he seated himself on the stool.</p>\n<p>“I returned day before yesterday,” he answered, while he leaned his arm\non the keys, bringing forth a crash of discordant sound.</p>\n<p>“Day before yesterday!” she repeated, aloud; and went on thinking to\nherself, “day before yesterday,” in a sort of an uncomprehending way.\nShe had pictured him seeking her at the very first hour, and he had\nlived under the same sky since day before yesterday; while only by\naccident had he stumbled upon her. Mademoiselle must have lied when she\nsaid, “Poor fool, he loves you.”</p>\n<p>“Day before yesterday,” she repeated, breaking off a spray of\nMademoiselle's geranium; “then if you had not met me here to-day you\nwouldn't--when--that is, didn't you mean to come and see me?”</p>\n<p>“Of course, I should have gone to see you. There have been so many\nthings--” he turned the leaves of Mademoiselle's music nervously. “I\nstarted in at once yesterday with the old firm. After all there is as\nmuch chance for me here as there was there--that is, I might find it\nprofitable some day. The Mexicans were not very congenial.”</p>\n<p>So he had come back because the Mexicans were not congenial; because\nbusiness was as profitable here as there; because of any reason, and not\nbecause he cared to be near her. She remembered the day she sat on the\nfloor, turning the pages of his letter, seeking the reason which was\nleft untold.</p>\n<p>She had not noticed how he looked--only feeling his presence; but she\nturned deliberately and observed him. After all, he had been absent but\na few months, and was not changed. His hair--the color of hers--waved\nback from his temples in the same way as before. His skin was not more\nburned than it had been at Grand Isle. She found in his eyes, when he\nlooked at her for one silent moment, the same tender caress, with an\nadded warmth and entreaty which had not been there before the same\nglance which had penetrated to the sleeping places of her soul and\nawakened them.</p>\n<p>A hundred times Edna had pictured Robert's return, and imagined their\nfirst meeting. It was usually at her home, whither he had sought her out\nat once. She always fancied him expressing or betraying in some way his\nlove for her. And here, the reality was that they sat ten feet apart,\nshe at the window, crushing geranium leaves in her hand and smelling\nthem, he twirling around on the piano stool, saying:</p>\n<p>“I was very much surprised to hear of Mr. Pontellier's absence; it's a\nwonder Mademoiselle Reisz did not tell me; and your moving--mother told\nme yesterday. I should think you would have gone to New York with him,\nor to Iberville with the children, rather than be bothered here with\nhousekeeping. And you are going abroad, too, I hear. We shan't have\nyou at Grand Isle next summer; it won't seem--do you see much of\nMademoiselle Reisz? She often spoke of you in the few letters she\nwrote.”</p>\n<p>“Do you remember that you promised to write to me when you went away?” A\nflush overspread his whole face.</p>\n<p>“I couldn't believe that my letters would be of any interest to you.”</p>\n<p>“That is an excuse; it isn't the truth.” Edna reached for her hat on the\npiano. She adjusted it, sticking the hat pin through the heavy coil of\nhair with some deliberation.</p>\n<p>“Are you not going to wait for Mademoiselle Reisz?” asked Robert.</p>\n<p>“No; I have found when she is absent this long, she is liable not to\ncome back till late.” She drew on her gloves, and Robert picked up his\nhat.</p>\n<p>“Won't you wait for her?” asked Edna.</p>\n<p>“Not if you think she will not be back till late,” adding, as if\nsuddenly aware of some discourtesy in his speech, “and I should miss the\npleasure of walking home with you.” Edna locked the door and put the key\nback in its hiding-place.</p>\n<p>They went together, picking their way across muddy streets and sidewalks\nencumbered with the cheap display of small tradesmen. Part of the\ndistance they rode in the car, and after disembarking, passed the\nPontellier mansion, which looked broken and half torn asunder. Robert\nhad never known the house, and looked at it with interest.</p>\n<p>“I never knew you in your home,” he remarked.</p>\n<p>“I am glad you did not.”</p>\n<p>“Why?” She did not answer. They went on around the corner, and it seemed\nas if her dreams were coming true after all, when he followed her into\nthe little house.</p>\n<p>“You must stay and dine with me, Robert. You see I am all alone, and it\nis so long since I have seen you. There is so much I want to ask you.”</p>\n<p>She took off her hat and gloves. He stood irresolute, making some excuse\nabout his mother who expected him; he even muttered something about an\nengagement. She struck a match and lit the lamp on the table; it was\ngrowing dusk. When he saw her face in the lamp-light, looking pained,\nwith all the soft lines gone out of it, he threw his hat aside and\nseated himself.</p>\n<p>“Oh! you know I want to stay if you will let me!” he exclaimed. All\nthe softness came back. She laughed, and went and put her hand on his\nshoulder.</p>\n<p>“This is the first moment you have seemed like the old Robert. I'll\ngo tell Celestine.” She hurried away to tell Celestine to set an extra\nplace. She even sent her off in search of some added delicacy which\nshe had not thought of for herself. And she recommended great care in\ndripping the coffee and having the omelet done to a proper turn.</p>\n<p>When she reentered, Robert was turning over magazines, sketches,\nand things that lay upon the table in great disorder. He picked up a\nphotograph, and exclaimed:</p>\n<p>“Alcee Arobin! What on earth is his picture doing here?”</p>\n<p>“I tried to make a sketch of his head one day,” answered Edna, “and\nhe thought the photograph might help me. It was at the other house. I\nthought it had been left there. I must have packed it up with my drawing\nmaterials.”</p>\n<p>“I should think you would give it back to him if you have finished with\nit.”</p>\n<p>“Oh! I have a great many such photographs. I never think of returning\nthem. They don't amount to anything.” Robert kept on looking at the\npicture.</p>\n<p>“It seems to me--do you think his head worth drawing? Is he a friend of\nMr. Pontellier's? You never said you knew him.”</p>\n<p>“He isn't a friend of Mr. Pontellier's; he's a friend of mine. I always\nknew him--that is, it is only of late that I know him pretty well. But\nI'd rather talk about you, and know what you have been seeing and doing\nand feeling out there in Mexico.” Robert threw aside the picture.</p>\n<p>“I've been seeing the waves and the white beach of Grand Isle; the\nquiet, grassy street of the Cheniere; the old fort at Grande Terre. I've\nbeen working like a machine, and feeling like a lost soul. There was\nnothing interesting.”</p>\n<p>She leaned her head upon her hand to shade her eyes from the light.</p>\n<p>“And what have you been seeing and doing and feeling all these days?” he\nasked.</p>\n<p>“I've been seeing the waves and the white beach of Grand Isle; the\nquiet, grassy street of the Cheniere Caminada; the old sunny fort at\nGrande Terre. I've been working with a little more comprehension than\na machine, and still feeling like a lost soul. There was nothing\ninteresting.”</p>\n<p>“Mrs. Pontellier, you are cruel,” he said, with feeling, closing his\neyes and resting his head back in his chair. They remained in silence\ntill old Celestine announced dinner.</p>\n<p>XXXIV</p>\n<p>The dining-room was very small. Edna's round mahogany would have almost\nfilled it. As it was there was but a step or two from the little table\nto the kitchen, to the mantel, the small buffet, and the side door that\nopened out on the narrow brick-paved yard.</p>\n<p>A certain degree of ceremony settled upon them with the announcement of\ndinner. There was no return to personalities. Robert related incidents\nof his sojourn in Mexico, and Edna talked of events likely to interest\nhim, which had occurred during his absence. The dinner was of ordinary\nquality, except for the few delicacies which she had sent out to\npurchase. Old Celestine, with a bandana tignon twisted about her head,\nhobbled in and out, taking a personal interest in everything; and she\nlingered occasionally to talk patois with Robert, whom she had known as\na boy.</p>\n<p>He went out to a neighboring cigar stand to purchase cigarette papers,\nand when he came back he found that Celestine had served the black\ncoffee in the parlor.</p>\n<p>“Perhaps I shouldn't have come back,” he said. “When you are tired of\nme, tell me to go.”</p>\n<p>“You never tire me. You must have forgotten the hours and hours at\nGrand Isle in which we grew accustomed to each other and used to being\ntogether.”</p>\n<p>“I have forgotten nothing at Grand Isle,” he said, not looking at her,\nbut rolling a cigarette. His tobacco pouch, which he laid upon the\ntable, was a fantastic embroidered silk affair, evidently the handiwork\nof a woman.</p>\n<p>“You used to carry your tobacco in a rubber pouch,” said Edna, picking\nup the pouch and examining the needlework.</p>\n<p>“Yes; it was lost.”</p>\n<p>“Where did you buy this one? In Mexico?”</p>\n<p>“It was given to me by a Vera Cruz girl; they are very generous,” he\nreplied, striking a match and lighting his cigarette.</p>\n<p>“They are very handsome, I suppose, those Mexican women; very\npicturesque, with their black eyes and their lace scarfs.”</p>\n<p>“Some are; others are hideous, just as you find women everywhere.”</p>\n<p>“What was she like--the one who gave you the pouch? You must have known\nher very well.”</p>\n<p>“She was very ordinary. She wasn't of the slightest importance. I knew\nher well enough.”</p>\n<p>“Did you visit at her house? Was it interesting? I should like to know\nand hear about the people you met, and the impressions they made on\nyou.”</p>\n<p>“There are some people who leave impressions not so lasting as the\nimprint of an oar upon the water.”</p>\n<p>“Was she such a one?”</p>\n<p>“It would be ungenerous for me to admit that she was of that order and\nkind.” He thrust the pouch back in his pocket, as if to put away the\nsubject with the trifle which had brought it up.</p>\n<p>Arobin dropped in with a message from Mrs. Merriman, to say that\nthe card party was postponed on account of the illness of one of her\nchildren.</p>\n<p>“How do you do, Arobin?” said Robert, rising from the obscurity.</p>\n<p>“Oh! Lebrun. To be sure! I heard yesterday you were back. How did they\ntreat you down in Mexique?”</p>\n<p>“Fairly well.”</p>\n<p>“But not well enough to keep you there. Stunning girls, though, in\nMexico. I thought I should never get away from Vera Cruz when I was down\nthere a couple of years ago.”</p>\n<p>“Did they embroider slippers and tobacco pouches and hat-bands and\nthings for you?” asked Edna.</p>\n<p>“Oh! my! no! I didn't get so deep in their regard. I fear they made more\nimpression on me than I made on them.”</p>\n<p>“You were less fortunate than Robert, then.”</p>\n<p>“I am always less fortunate than Robert. Has he been imparting tender\nconfidences?”</p>\n<p>“I've been imposing myself long enough,” said Robert, rising, and\nshaking hands with Edna. “Please convey my regards to Mr. Pontellier\nwhen you write.”</p>\n<p>He shook hands with Arobin and went away.</p>\n<p>“Fine fellow, that Lebrun,” said Arobin when Robert had gone. “I never\nheard you speak of him.”</p>\n<p>“I knew him last summer at Grand Isle,” she replied. “Here is that\nphotograph of yours. Don't you want it?”</p>\n<p>“What do I want with it? Throw it away.” She threw it back on the table.</p>\n<p>“I'm not going to Mrs. Merriman's,” she said. “If you see her, tell her\nso. But perhaps I had better write. I think I shall write now, and say\nthat I am sorry her child is sick, and tell her not to count on me.”</p>\n<p>“It would be a good scheme,” acquiesced Arobin. “I don't blame you;\nstupid lot!”</p>\n<p>Edna opened the blotter, and having procured paper and pen, began to\nwrite the note. Arobin lit a cigar and read the evening paper, which he\nhad in his pocket.</p>\n<p>“What is the date?” she asked. He told her.</p>\n<p>“Will you mail this for me when you go out?”</p>\n<p>“Certainly.” He read to her little bits out of the newspaper, while she\nstraightened things on the table.</p>\n<p>“What do you want to do?” he asked, throwing aside the paper. “Do you\nwant to go out for a walk or a drive or anything? It would be a fine\nnight to drive.”</p>\n<p>“No; I don't want to do anything but just be quiet. You go away and\namuse yourself. Don't stay.”</p>\n<p>“I'll go away if I must; but I shan't amuse myself. You know that I only\nlive when I am near you.”</p>\n<p>He stood up to bid her good night.</p>\n<p>“Is that one of the things you always say to women?”</p>\n<p>“I have said it before, but I don't think I ever came so near meaning\nit,” he answered with a smile. There were no warm lights in her eyes;\nonly a dreamy, absent look.</p>\n<p>“Good night. I adore you. Sleep well,” he said, and he kissed her hand\nand went away.</p>\n<p>She stayed alone in a kind of reverie--a sort of stupor. Step by step\nshe lived over every instant of the time she had been with Robert after\nhe had entered Mademoiselle Reisz's door. She recalled his words,\nhis looks. How few and meager they had been for her hungry heart! A\nvision--a transcendently seductive vision of a Mexican girl arose before\nher. She writhed with a jealous pang. She wondered when he would come\nback. He had not said he would come back. She had been with him, had\nheard his voice and touched his hand. But some way he had seemed nearer\nto her off there in Mexico.</p>\n<p>XXXV</p>\n<p>The morning was full of sunlight and hope. Edna could see before her no\ndenial--only the promise of excessive joy. She lay in bed awake, with\nbright eyes full of speculation. “He loves you, poor fool.” If she could\nbut get that conviction firmly fixed in her mind, what mattered about\nthe rest? She felt she had been childish and unwise the night before in\ngiving herself over to despondency. She recapitulated the motives which\nno doubt explained Robert's reserve. They were not insurmountable; they\nwould not hold if he really loved her; they could not hold against her\nown passion, which he must come to realize in time. She pictured him\ngoing to his business that morning. She even saw how he was dressed;\nhow he walked down one street, and turned the corner of another; saw him\nbending over his desk, talking to people who entered the office, going\nto his lunch, and perhaps watching for her on the street. He would come\nto her in the afternoon or evening, sit and roll his cigarette, talk a\nlittle, and go away as he had done the night before. But how delicious\nit would be to have him there with her! She would have no regrets, nor\nseek to penetrate his reserve if he still chose to wear it.</p>\n<p>Edna ate her breakfast only half dressed. The maid brought her a\ndelicious printed scrawl from Raoul, expressing his love, asking her to\nsend him some bonbons, and telling her they had found that morning ten\ntiny white pigs all lying in a row beside Lidie's big white pig.</p>\n<p>A letter also came from her husband, saying he hoped to be back early\nin March, and then they would get ready for that journey abroad which\nhe had promised her so long, which he felt now fully able to afford;\nhe felt able to travel as people should, without any thought of small\neconomies--thanks to his recent speculations in Wall Street.</p>\n<p>Much to her surprise she received a note from Arobin, written at\nmidnight from the club. It was to say good morning to her, to hope she\nhad slept well, to assure her of his devotion, which he trusted she in\nsome faintest manner returned.</p>\n<p>All these letters were pleasing to her. She answered the children in a\ncheerful frame of mind, promising them bonbons, and congratulating them\nupon their happy find of the little pigs.</p>\n<p>She answered her husband with friendly evasiveness,--not with any fixed\ndesign to mislead him, only because all sense of reality had gone out\nof her life; she had abandoned herself to Fate, and awaited the\nconsequences with indifference.</p>\n<p>To Arobin's note she made no reply. She put it under Celestine's\nstove-lid.</p>\n<p>Edna worked several hours with much spirit. She saw no one but a picture\ndealer, who asked her if it were true that she was going abroad to study\nin Paris.</p>\n<p>She said possibly she might, and he negotiated with her for some\nParisian studies to reach him in time for the holiday trade in December.</p>\n<p>Robert did not come that day. She was keenly disappointed. He did not\ncome the following day, nor the next. Each morning she awoke with hope,\nand each night she was a prey to despondency. She was tempted to seek\nhim out. But far from yielding to the impulse, she avoided any occasion\nwhich might throw her in his way. She did not go to Mademoiselle Reisz's\nnor pass by Madame Lebrun's, as she might have done if he had still been\nin Mexico.</p>\n<p>When Arobin, one night, urged her to drive with him, she went--out to\nthe lake, on the Shell Road. His horses were full of mettle, and even a\nlittle unmanageable. She liked the rapid gait at which they spun along,\nand the quick, sharp sound of the horses' hoofs on the hard road. They\ndid not stop anywhere to eat or to drink. Arobin was not needlessly\nimprudent. But they ate and they drank when they regained Edna's little\ndining-room--which was comparatively early in the evening.</p>\n<p>It was late when he left her. It was getting to be more than a passing\nwhim with Arobin to see her and be with her. He had detected the latent\nsensuality, which unfolded under his delicate sense of her nature's\nrequirements like a torpid, torrid, sensitive blossom.</p>\n<p>There was no despondency when she fell asleep that night; nor was there\nhope when she awoke in the morning.</p>\n<h2 id=\"xxxvi\"><a href=\"#xxxvi\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>XXXVI</h2>\n<p>There was a garden out in the suburbs; a small, leafy corner, with a\nfew green tables under the orange trees. An old cat slept all day on the\nstone step in the sun, and an old mulatresse slept her idle hours away\nin her chair at the open window, till some one happened to knock on one\nof the green tables. She had milk and cream cheese to sell, and bread\nand butter. There was no one who could make such excellent coffee or fry\na chicken so golden brown as she.</p>\n<p>The place was too modest to attract the attention of people of fashion,\nand so quiet as to have escaped the notice of those in search of\npleasure and dissipation. Edna had discovered it accidentally one day\nwhen the high-board gate stood ajar. She caught sight of a little green\ntable, blotched with the checkered sunlight that filtered through\nthe quivering leaves overhead. Within she had found the slumbering\nmulatresse, the drowsy cat, and a glass of milk which reminded her of\nthe milk she had tasted in Iberville.</p>\n<p>She often stopped there during her perambulations; sometimes taking a\nbook with her, and sitting an hour or two under the trees when she found\nthe place deserted. Once or twice she took a quiet dinner there alone,\nhaving instructed Celestine beforehand to prepare no dinner at home. It\nwas the last place in the city where she would have expected to meet any\none she knew.</p>\n<p>Still she was not astonished when, as she was partaking of a modest\ndinner late in the afternoon, looking into an open book, stroking the\ncat, which had made friends with her--she was not greatly astonished to\nsee Robert come in at the tall garden gate.</p>\n<p>“I am destined to see you only by accident,” she said, shoving the\ncat off the chair beside her. He was surprised, ill at ease, almost\nembarrassed at meeting her thus so unexpectedly.</p>\n<p>“Do you come here often?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“I almost live here,” she said.</p>\n<p>“I used to drop in very often for a cup of Catiche's good coffee. This\nis the first time since I came back.”</p>\n<p>“She'll bring you a plate, and you will share my dinner. There's always\nenough for two--even three.” Edna had intended to be indifferent and as\nreserved as he when she met him; she had reached the determination by a\nlaborious train of reasoning, incident to one of her despondent moods.\nBut her resolve melted when she saw him before designing Providence had\nled him into her path.</p>\n<p>“Why have you kept away from me, Robert?” she asked, closing the book\nthat lay open upon the table.</p>\n<p>“Why are you so personal, Mrs. Pontellier? Why do you force me to\nidiotic subterfuges?” he exclaimed with sudden warmth. “I suppose\nthere's no use telling you I've been very busy, or that I've been sick,\nor that I've been to see you and not found you at home. Please let me\noff with any one of these excuses.”</p>\n<p>“You are the embodiment of selfishness,” she said. “You save yourself\nsomething--I don't know what--but there is some selfish motive, and in\nsparing yourself you never consider for a moment what I think, or how\nI feel your neglect and indifference. I suppose this is what you would\ncall unwomanly; but I have got into a habit of expressing myself. It\ndoesn't matter to me, and you may think me unwomanly if you like.”</p>\n<p>“No; I only think you cruel, as I said the other day. Maybe not\nintentionally cruel; but you seem to be forcing me into disclosures\nwhich can result in nothing; as if you would have me bare a wound for\nthe pleasure of looking at it, without the intention or power of healing\nit.”</p>\n<p>“I'm spoiling your dinner, Robert; never mind what I say. You haven't\neaten a morsel.”</p>\n<p>“I only came in for a cup of coffee.” His sensitive face was all\ndisfigured with excitement.</p>\n<p>“Isn't this a delightful place?” she remarked. “I am so glad it has\nnever actually been discovered. It is so quiet, so sweet, here. Do you\nnotice there is scarcely a sound to be heard? It's so out of the way;\nand a good walk from the car. However, I don't mind walking. I always\nfeel so sorry for women who don't like to walk; they miss so much--so\nmany rare little glimpses of life; and we women learn so little of life\non the whole.</p>\n<p>“Catiche's coffee is always hot. I don't know how she manages it, here\nin the open air. Celestine's coffee gets cold bringing it from the\nkitchen to the dining-room. Three lumps! How can you drink it so sweet?\nTake some of the cress with your chop; it's so biting and crisp. Then\nthere's the advantage of being able to smoke with your coffee out here.\nNow, in the city--aren't you going to smoke?”</p>\n<p>“After a while,” he said, laying a cigar on the table.</p>\n<p>“Who gave it to you?” she laughed.</p>\n<p>“I bought it. I suppose I'm getting reckless; I bought a whole box.” She\nwas determined not to be personal again and make him uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>The cat made friends with him, and climbed into his lap when he smoked\nhis cigar. He stroked her silky fur, and talked a little about her. He\nlooked at Edna's book, which he had read; and he told her the end, to\nsave her the trouble of wading through it, he said.</p>\n<p>Again he accompanied her back to her home; and it was after dusk when\nthey reached the little “pigeon-house.” She did not ask him to remain,\nwhich he was grateful for, as it permitted him to stay without the\ndiscomfort of blundering through an excuse which he had no intention\nof considering. He helped her to light the lamp; then she went into her\nroom to take off her hat and to bathe her face and hands.</p>\n<p>When she came back Robert was not examining the pictures and magazines\nas before; he sat off in the shadow, leaning his head back on the chair\nas if in a reverie. Edna lingered a moment beside the table, arranging\nthe books there. Then she went across the room to where he sat. She bent\nover the arm of his chair and called his name.</p>\n<p>“Robert,” she said, “are you asleep?”</p>\n<p>“No,” he answered, looking up at her.</p>\n<p>She leaned over and kissed him--a soft, cool, delicate kiss, whose\nvoluptuous sting penetrated his whole being--then she moved away from\nhim. He followed, and took her in his arms, just holding her close to\nhim. She put her hand up to his face and pressed his cheek against her\nown. The action was full of love and tenderness. He sought her lips\nagain. Then he drew her down upon the sofa beside him and held her hand\nin both of his.</p>\n<p>“Now you know,” he said, “now you know what I have been fighting against\nsince last summer at Grand Isle; what drove me away and drove me back\nagain.”</p>\n<p>“Why have you been fighting against it?” she asked. Her face glowed with\nsoft lights.</p>\n<p>“Why? Because you were not free; you were Leonce Pontellier's wife. I\ncouldn't help loving you if you were ten times his wife; but so long as\nI went away from you and kept away I could help telling you so.” She put\nher free hand up to his shoulder, and then against his cheek, rubbing it\nsoftly. He kissed her again. His face was warm and flushed.</p>\n<p>“There in Mexico I was thinking of you all the time, and longing for\nyou.”</p>\n<p>“But not writing to me,” she interrupted.</p>\n<p>“Something put into my head that you cared for me; and I lost my senses.\nI forgot everything but a wild dream of your some way becoming my wife.”</p>\n<p>“Your wife!”</p>\n<p>“Religion, loyalty, everything would give way if only you cared.”</p>\n<p>“Then you must have forgotten that I was Leonce Pontellier's wife.”</p>\n<p>“Oh! I was demented, dreaming of wild, impossible things, recalling men\nwho had set their wives free, we have heard of such things.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, we have heard of such things.”</p>\n<p>“I came back full of vague, mad intentions. And when I got here--”</p>\n<p>“When you got here you never came near me!” She was still caressing his\ncheek.</p>\n<p>“I realized what a cur I was to dream of such a thing, even if you had\nbeen willing.”</p>\n<p>She took his face between her hands and looked into it as if she would\nnever withdraw her eyes more. She kissed him on the forehead, the eyes,\nthe cheeks, and the lips.</p>\n<p>“You have been a very, very foolish boy, wasting your time dreaming of\nimpossible things when you speak of Mr. Pontellier setting me free! I\nam no longer one of Mr. Pontellier's possessions to dispose of or not.\nI give myself where I choose. If he were to say, 'Here, Robert, take her\nand be happy; she is yours,' I should laugh at you both.”</p>\n<p>His face grew a little white. “What do you mean?” he asked.</p>\n<p>There was a knock at the door. Old Celestine came in to say that Madame\nRatignolle's servant had come around the back way with a message that\nMadame had been taken sick and begged Mrs. Pontellier to go to her\nimmediately.</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes,” said Edna, rising; “I promised. Tell her yes--to wait for\nme. I'll go back with her.”</p>\n<p>“Let me walk over with you,” offered Robert.</p>\n<p>“No,” she said; “I will go with the servant.” She went into her room to\nput on her hat, and when she came in again she sat once more upon the\nsofa beside him. He had not stirred. She put her arms about his neck.</p>\n<p>“Good-by, my sweet Robert. Tell me good-by.” He kissed her with a degree\nof passion which had not before entered into his caress, and strained\nher to him.</p>\n<p>“I love you,” she whispered, “only you; no one but you. It was you who\nawoke me last summer out of a life-long, stupid dream. Oh! you have made\nme so unhappy with your indifference. Oh! I have suffered, suffered! Now\nyou are here we shall love each other, my Robert. We shall be everything\nto each other. Nothing else in the world is of any consequence. I must\ngo to my friend; but you will wait for me? No matter how late; you will\nwait for me, Robert?”</p>\n<p>“Don't go; don't go! Oh! Edna, stay with me,” he pleaded. “Why should\nyou go? Stay with me, stay with me.”</p>\n<p>“I shall come back as soon as I can; I shall find you here.” She buried\nher face in his neck, and said good-by again. Her seductive voice,\ntogether with his great love for her, had enthralled his senses, had\ndeprived him of every impulse but the longing to hold her and keep her.</p>\n<p>XXXVII</p>\n<p>Edna looked in at the drug store. Monsieur Ratignolle was putting up\na mixture himself, very carefully, dropping a red liquid into a tiny\nglass. He was grateful to Edna for having come; her presence would be\na comfort to his wife. Madame Ratignolle's sister, who had always been\nwith her at such trying times, had not been able to come up from the\nplantation, and Adele had been inconsolable until Mrs. Pontellier so\nkindly promised to come to her. The nurse had been with them at night\nfor the past week, as she lived a great distance away. And Dr. Mandelet\nhad been coming and going all the afternoon. They were then looking for\nhim any moment.</p>\n<p>Edna hastened upstairs by a private stairway that led from the rear of\nthe store to the apartments above. The children were all sleeping in a\nback room. Madame Ratignolle was in the salon, whither she had strayed\nin her suffering impatience. She sat on the sofa, clad in an ample\nwhite peignoir, holding a handkerchief tight in her hand with a nervous\nclutch. Her face was drawn and pinched, her sweet blue eyes haggard and\nunnatural. All her beautiful hair had been drawn back and plaited. It\nlay in a long braid on the sofa pillow, coiled like a golden serpent.\nThe nurse, a comfortable looking Griffe woman in white apron and cap,\nwas urging her to return to her bedroom.</p>\n<p>“There is no use, there is no use,” she said at once to Edna. “We must\nget rid of Mandelet; he is getting too old and careless. He said he\nwould be here at half-past seven; now it must be eight. See what time it\nis, Josephine.”</p>\n<p>The woman was possessed of a cheerful nature, and refused to take any\nsituation too seriously, especially a situation with which she was so\nfamiliar. She urged Madame to have courage and patience. But Madame only\nset her teeth hard into her under lip, and Edna saw the sweat gather\nin beads on her white forehead. After a moment or two she uttered a\nprofound sigh and wiped her face with the handkerchief rolled in a\nball. She appeared exhausted. The nurse gave her a fresh handkerchief,\nsprinkled with cologne water.</p>\n<p>“This is too much!” she cried. “Mandelet ought to be killed! Where is\nAlphonse? Is it possible I am to be abandoned like this--neglected by\nevery one?”</p>\n<p>“Neglected, indeed!” exclaimed the nurse. Wasn't she there? And here was\nMrs. Pontellier leaving, no doubt, a pleasant evening at home to devote\nto her? And wasn't Monsieur Ratignolle coming that very instant through\nthe hall? And Josephine was quite sure she had heard Doctor Mandelet's\ncoupe. Yes, there it was, down at the door.</p>\n<p>Adele consented to go back to her room. She sat on the edge of a little\nlow couch next to her bed.</p>\n<p>Doctor Mandelet paid no attention to Madame Ratignolle's upbraidings. He\nwas accustomed to them at such times, and was too well convinced of her\nloyalty to doubt it.</p>\n<p>He was glad to see Edna, and wanted her to go with him into the salon\nand entertain him. But Madame Ratignolle would not consent that Edna\nshould leave her for an instant. Between agonizing moments, she chatted\na little, and said it took her mind off her sufferings.</p>\n<p>Edna began to feel uneasy. She was seized with a vague dread. Her own\nlike experiences seemed far away, unreal, and only half remembered. She\nrecalled faintly an ecstasy of pain, the heavy odor of chloroform, a\nstupor which had deadened sensation, and an awakening to find a little\nnew life to which she had given being, added to the great unnumbered\nmultitude of souls that come and go.</p>\n<p>She began to wish she had not come; her presence was not necessary. She\nmight have invented a pretext for staying away; she might even invent a\npretext now for going. But Edna did not go. With an inward agony, with a\nflaming, outspoken revolt against the ways of Nature, she witnessed the\nscene of torture.</p>\n<p>She was still stunned and speechless with emotion when later she leaned\nover her friend to kiss her and softly say good-by. Adele, pressing her\ncheek, whispered in an exhausted voice: “Think of the children, Edna. Oh\nthink of the children! Remember them!”</p>\n<p>XXXVIII</p>\n<p>Edna still felt dazed when she got outside in the open air. The Doctor's\ncoupe had returned for him and stood before the porte cochere. She did\nnot wish to enter the coupe, and told Doctor Mandelet she would walk;\nshe was not afraid, and would go alone. He directed his carriage to meet\nhim at Mrs. Pontellier's, and he started to walk home with her.</p>\n<p>Up--away up, over the narrow street between the tall houses, the stars\nwere blazing. The air was mild and caressing, but cool with the breath\nof spring and the night. They walked slowly, the Doctor with a heavy,\nmeasured tread and his hands behind him; Edna, in an absent-minded way,\nas she had walked one night at Grand Isle, as if her thoughts had gone\nahead of her and she was striving to overtake them.</p>\n<p>“You shouldn't have been there, Mrs. Pontellier,” he said. “That was no\nplace for you. Adele is full of whims at such times. There were a dozen\nwomen she might have had with her, unimpressionable women. I felt that\nit was cruel, cruel. You shouldn't have gone.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, well!” she answered, indifferently. “I don't know that it matters\nafter all. One has to think of the children some time or other; the\nsooner the better.”</p>\n<p>“When is Leonce coming back?”</p>\n<p>“Quite soon. Some time in March.”</p>\n<p>“And you are going abroad?”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps--no, I am not going. I'm not going to be forced into doing\nthings. I don't want to go abroad. I want to be let alone. Nobody has\nany right--except children, perhaps--and even then, it seems to me--or\nit did seem--” She felt that her speech was voicing the incoherency of\nher thoughts, and stopped abruptly.</p>\n<p>“The trouble is,” sighed the Doctor, grasping her meaning intuitively,\n“that youth is given up to illusions. It seems to be a provision of\nNature; a decoy to secure mothers for the race. And Nature takes no\naccount of moral consequences, of arbitrary conditions which we create,\nand which we feel obliged to maintain at any cost.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” she said. “The years that are gone seem like dreams--if one might\ngo on sleeping and dreaming--but to wake up and find--oh! well! perhaps\nit is better to wake up after all, even to suffer, rather than to remain\na dupe to illusions all one's life.”</p>\n<p>“It seems to me, my dear child,” said the Doctor at parting, holding her\nhand, “you seem to me to be in trouble. I am not going to ask for your\nconfidence. I will only say that if ever you feel moved to give it to\nme, perhaps I might help you. I know I would understand. And I tell you\nthere are not many who would--not many, my dear.”</p>\n<p>“Some way I don't feel moved to speak of things that trouble me. Don't\nthink I am ungrateful or that I don't appreciate your sympathy. There\nare periods of despondency and suffering which take possession of me.\nBut I don't want anything but my own way. That is wanting a good deal,\nof course, when you have to trample upon the lives, the hearts, the\nprejudices of others--but no matter--still, I shouldn't want to trample\nupon the little lives. Oh! I don't know what I'm saying, Doctor. Good\nnight. Don't blame me for anything.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, I will blame you if you don't come and see me soon. We will talk\nof things you never have dreamt of talking about before. It will do\nus both good. I don't want you to blame yourself, whatever comes. Good\nnight, my child.”</p>\n<p>She let herself in at the gate, but instead of entering she sat upon\nthe step of the porch. The night was quiet and soothing. All the tearing\nemotion of the last few hours seemed to fall away from her like a\nsomber, uncomfortable garment, which she had but to loosen to be rid of.\nShe went back to that hour before Adele had sent for her; and her senses\nkindled afresh in thinking of Robert's words, the pressure of his arms,\nand the feeling of his lips upon her own. She could picture at that\nmoment no greater bliss on earth than possession of the beloved one.\nHis expression of love had already given him to her in part. When she\nthought that he was there at hand, waiting for her, she grew numb with\nthe intoxication of expectancy. It was so late; he would be asleep\nperhaps. She would awaken him with a kiss. She hoped he would be asleep\nthat she might arouse him with her caresses.</p>\n<p>Still, she remembered Adele's voice whispering, “Think of the children;\nthink of them.” She meant to think of them; that determination had\ndriven into her soul like a death wound--but not to-night. To-morrow\nwould be time to think of everything.</p>\n<p>Robert was not waiting for her in the little parlor. He was nowhere at\nhand. The house was empty. But he had scrawled on a piece of paper that\nlay in the lamplight:</p>\n<p>“I love you. Good-by--because I love you.”</p>\n<p>Edna grew faint when she read the words. She went and sat on the sofa.\nThen she stretched herself out there, never uttering a sound. She did\nnot sleep. She did not go to bed. The lamp sputtered and went out. She\nwas still awake in the morning, when Celestine unlocked the kitchen door\nand came in to light the fire.</p>\n<p>XXXIX</p>\n<p>Victor, with hammer and nails and scraps of scantling, was patching a corner of one of the galleries. Mariequita sat near by, dangling her legs, watching him work, and handing him nails from the tool-box. The sun was beating down upon them. The girl had covered her head with her apron folded into a square pad. They had been talking for an hour or more. She was never tired of hearing Victor describe the dinner at Mrs. Pontellier's. He exaggerated every detail, making it appear a veritable Lucullean feast. The flowers were in tubs, he said. The champagne was quaffed from huge golden goblets. Venus rising from the foam could have presented no more entrancing a spectacle than Mrs. Pontellier, blazing with beauty and diamonds at the head of the board, while the other women were all of them youthful houris, possessed of incomparable charms. She got it into her head that Victor was in love with Mrs. Pontellier, and he gave her evasive answers, framed so as to confirm her belief. She grew sullen and cried a little, threatening to go off and leave him to his fine ladies. There were a dozen men crazy about her at the Cheniere; and since it was the fashion to be in love with married people, why, she could run away any time she liked to New Orleans with Celina's husband.</p>\n<p>Celina's husband was a fool, a coward, and a pig, and to prove it to her, Victor intended to hammer his head into a jelly the next time he encountered him. This assurance was very consoling to Mariequita. She dried her eyes, and grew cheerful at the prospect.</p>\n<p>They were still talking of the dinner and the allurements of city life when Mrs. Pontellier herself slipped around the corner of the house. The two youngsters stayed dumb with amazement before what they considered to be an apparition. But it was really she in flesh and blood, looking tired and a little travel-stained.</p>\n<p>“I walked up from the wharf,” she said, “and heard the hammering. I supposed it was you, mending the porch. It's a good thing. I was always tripping over those loose planks last summer. How dreary and deserted everything looks!”</p>\n<p>It took Victor some little time to comprehend that she had come in Beaudelet's lugger, that she had come alone, and for no purpose but to rest.</p>\n<p>“There's nothing fixed up yet, you see. I'll give you my room; it's the only place.”</p>\n<p>“Any corner will do,” she assured him.</p>\n<p>“And if you can stand Philomel's cooking,” he went on, “though I might try to get her mother while you are here. Do you think she would come?” turning to Mariequita.</p>\n<p>Mariequita thought that perhaps Philomel's mother might come for a few days, and money enough.</p>\n<p>Beholding Mrs. Pontellier make her appearance, the girl had at once suspected a lovers' rendezvous. But Victor's astonishment was so genuine, and Mrs. Pontellier's indifference so apparent, that the disturbing notion did not lodge long in her brain. She contemplated with the greatest interest this woman who gave the most sumptuous dinners in America, and who had all the men in New Orleans at her feet.</p>\n<p>“What time will you have dinner?” asked Edna. “I'm very hungry; but don't get anything extra.”</p>\n<p>“I'll have it ready in little or no time,” he said, bustling and packing away his tools. “You may go to my room to brush up and rest yourself. Mariequita will show you.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you,” said Edna. “But, do you know, I have a notion to go down to\nthe beach and take a good wash and even a little swim, before dinner?”</p>\n<p>“The water is too cold!” they both exclaimed. “Don't think of it.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I might go down and try--dip my toes in. Why, it seems to me the\nsun is hot enough to have warmed the very depths of the ocean. Could you\nget me a couple of towels? I'd better go right away, so as to be back in\ntime. It would be a little too chilly if I waited till this afternoon.”</p>\n<p>Mariequita ran over to Victor's room, and returned with some towels,\nwhich she gave to Edna.</p>\n<p>“I hope you have fish for dinner,” said Edna, as she started to walk\naway; “but don't do anything extra if you haven't.”</p>\n<p>“Run and find Philomel's mother,” Victor instructed the girl. “I'll\ngo to the kitchen and see what I can do. By Gimminy! Women have no\nconsideration! She might have sent me word.”</p>\n<p>Edna walked on down to the beach rather mechanically, not noticing\nanything special except that the sun was hot. She was not dwelling upon\nany particular train of thought. She had done all the thinking which was\nnecessary after Robert went away, when she lay awake upon the sofa till\nmorning.</p>\n<p>She had said over and over to herself: “To-day it is Arobin; to-morrow\nit will be some one else. It makes no difference to me, it doesn't\nmatter about Leonce Pontellier--but Raoul and Etienne!” She understood\nnow clearly what she had meant long ago when she said to Adele\nRatignolle that she would give up the unessential, but she would never\nsacrifice herself for her children.</p>\n<p>Despondency had come upon her there in the wakeful night, and had never\nlifted. There was no one thing in the world that she desired. There\nwas no human being whom she wanted near her except Robert; and she even\nrealized that the day would come when he, too, and the thought of\nhim would melt out of her existence, leaving her alone. The children\nappeared before her like antagonists who had overcome her; who had\noverpowered and sought to drag her into the soul's slavery for the rest\nof her days. But she knew a way to elude them. She was not thinking of\nthese things when she walked down to the beach.</p>\n<p>The water of the Gulf stretched out before her, gleaming with the\nmillion lights of the sun. The voice of the sea is seductive, never\nceasing, whispering, clamoring, murmuring, inviting the soul to wander\nin abysses of solitude. All along the white beach, up and down, there\nwas no living thing in sight. A bird with a broken wing was beating\nthe air above, reeling, fluttering, circling disabled down, down to the\nwater.</p>\n<p>Edna had found her old bathing suit still hanging, faded, upon its\naccustomed peg.</p>\n<p>She put it on, leaving her clothing in the bath-house. But when she\nwas there beside the sea, absolutely alone, she cast the unpleasant,\npricking garments from her, and for the first time in her life she stood\nnaked in the open air, at the mercy of the sun, the breeze that beat\nupon her, and the waves that invited her.</p>\n<p>How strange and awful it seemed to stand naked under the sky! how\ndelicious! She felt like some new-born creature, opening its eyes in a\nfamiliar world that it had never known.</p>\n<p>The foamy wavelets curled up to her white feet, and coiled like serpents\nabout her ankles. She walked out. The water was chill, but she walked\non. The water was deep, but she lifted her white body and reached\nout with a long, sweeping stroke. The touch of the sea is sensuous,\nenfolding the body in its soft, close embrace.</p>\n<p>She went on and on. She remembered the night she swam far out, and\nrecalled the terror that seized her at the fear of being unable to\nregain the shore. She did not look back now, but went on and on,\nthinking of the blue-grass meadow that she had traversed when a little\nchild, believing that it had no beginning and no end.</p>\n<p>Her arms and legs were growing tired.</p>\n<p>She thought of Leonce and the children. They were a part of her life.\nBut they need not have thought that they could possess her, body and\nsoul. How Mademoiselle Reisz would have laughed, perhaps sneered, if she\nknew! “And you call yourself an artist! What pretensions, Madame! The\nartist must possess the courageous soul that dares and defies.”</p>\n<p>Exhaustion was pressing upon and overpowering her.</p>\n<p>“Good-by--because I love you.” He did not know; he did not understand.\nHe would never understand. Perhaps Doctor Mandelet would have understood\nif she had seen him--but it was too late; the shore was far behind her,\nand her strength was gone.</p>\n<p>She looked into the distance, and the old terror flamed up for an\ninstant, then sank again. Edna heard her father's voice and her sister\nMargaret's. She heard the barking of an old dog that was chained to the\nsycamore tree. The spurs of the cavalry officer clanged as he walked\nacross the porch. There was the hum of bees, and the musky odor of pinks\nfilled the air.</p>","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/text/narrative/#the-awakening\">THE AWAKENING</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/text/narrative/#i\">I</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/text/narrative/#ii\">II</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/text/narrative/#xxxvi\">XXXVI</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Awakening","author":"Kate Chopin"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/text/narrative/"}}
