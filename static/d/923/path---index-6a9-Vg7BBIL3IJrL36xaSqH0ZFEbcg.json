{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Ed. is a <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby</a> theme designed for textual editors based on <a href=\"http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/\">minimal computing principles</a>, and focused on legibility, durability, ease and flexibility. Ed. is based on a <a href=\"https://github.com/minicomp/ed\">Jekyll theme of the same name</a>, originally designed by Alex Gil and brill friends. The goal of Ed. was to update the existing project to leverage javascript, client-side rendering, and the modern JAMStack. The underlying technology is easy to learn and teach, and can produce beautifully rendered scholarly or reading editions of texts meant to last. To start using Ed., please see the [documentation] for installation instructions and more. To learn more about the ideas behind Ed. and a list of current features see the [about] section.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"hi.","type":"page"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/"}}
