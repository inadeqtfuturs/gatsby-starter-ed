- DELAYED till she had ceased to know,	
- Delayed till in its vest of snow	
- [Her loving bosom lay.]{.indent-2}
- An hour behind the fleeting breath,	
- Later by just an hour than death,—
- [Oh, lagging yesterday!]{.indent-2}


- Could she have guessed that it would be;	
- Could but a crier of the glee	
- [Have climbed the distant hill;]{.indent-2}
- Had not the bliss so slow a pace,—
- Who knows but this surrendered face	
- [Were undefeated still?]{.indent-2}


- Oh, if there may departing be	
- Any forgot by victory	
- [In her imperial round,]{.indent-2}
- Show them this meek apparelled thing,	
- That could not stop to be a king,	
- [Doubtful if it be crowned!]{.indent-2}
