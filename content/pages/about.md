I built Ed. to serve two purposes: to help curate sustainable, minimal editions following the goal of the original Jekyll theme (read more [here](https://elotroalex.github.io/ed/about/)), and to update that theme/tool for the modern JAMStack. Using Gatsby, the underlying concepts of authoring, editing, and curating in [plain text](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown) remain the same. What's changed is the static site generator.

Ed. works largely out of the box--you only need to configure as much as you want to. Utilizing the included Markdown template, editors can define most everything needed for a minimal edition, including footnotes, line breaks, and a bibliography. Because Gatsby produces static HTML, CSS, and javascript, there's little to no risk of obsolescence, and users benefit from modern javascript technologies like service workers and client side rendering.
